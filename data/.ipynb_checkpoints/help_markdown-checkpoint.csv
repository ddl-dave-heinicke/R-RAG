https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/how-to-earn-cash-back-360002117047,"Earning Cash Back with Rakuten is simple.

1.  Start at Rakuten and choose a store. You can use our website, mobile app, or browser extension.
2.  Activate Cash Back to start shopping. Once you make an eligible purchase, we’ll add Cash Back to your account.
3.  Get paid! Add your address and get paid via check or PayPal.

That’s all you have to do.

Once a store confirms your purchase with us, we add Cash Back to your account and notify you via email or push notification. The time it takes for Cash Back to be confirmed depends on several factors, including the store, store policy, reporting schedule, exclusions and returns.

We’ll send your first payment as soon as 15 days after your first purchase. After that, we’ll send your Cash Back payment [every three months](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/help/article/getting-your-rakuten-cash-back-payments-360002117667). If there’s any Cash Back pending, we’ll carry it over to your next payment.

Remember, you can only earn Cash Back if you start shopping at Rakuten. If you make a purchase without going through Rakuten, we won't be able to reward you with Cash Back. You can always try our browser extension which will notify you about Cash Back deals when you’re on a website. It’ll even find coupons for you!

How does Rakuten make money?

We know, it seems too good to be true. Here’s the deal: Stores pay us for sending them shoppers. Then we split that money with you as Cash Back. Everyone wins!"
https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/how-to-join-rakuten-360002101108,"Joining Rakuten is simple and free. Once you sign up, you can start shopping and earning Cash Back on qualifying purchases.

**Creating a Rakuten account**

Create a secure account with an email and password. You can also join using your Facebook, or Google or Apple account.

**Friend referrals**

Love Rakuten? Spread the word of Cash Back with friends and we’ll give a bonus to you and a bonus to them!

If you were referred by a friend, there are two ways to make sure everyone gets their bonus:

*   Use the link that was sent to you by your friend. It’s the easiest way!
*   When prompted to join, select “Did someone refer you?” at the bottom of the form and enter your friend’s email. Your friend’s email must be the one they use for their Rakuten account."
https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/company-overview-360002116927,"Welcome to Rakuten, the best way to earn Cash Back and find deep discounts when you shop. Since 1997, Rakuten has helped shape the way people shop online. We acquired Ebates in 2014 and have grown to over 12 million members to remain the largest, free member-based savings programs in the U.S. To date, our members have earned over $1 billion in Cash Back.

**How does Rakuten work?**

Rakuten saves you money by using a simple business model: Stores pay Rakuten a commission for sending our members to shop at their websites. Rakuten then splits that commission with you, in the form of Cash Back.

To earn Cash Back:

1.  Join Rakuten: It’s free and only requires an email address and a password.
2.  Start a shopping trip with Rakuten by clicking on one of our links (on our site, in an email or in our mobile app, for example).
3.  You’ll be notified that Cash Back has been activated, and then just shop as you normally would.

And that’s it! Once the store notifies us of your order, Cash Back will be added to your account. Then, every quarter, we send you your Cash Back as a Big Fat Check or PayPal payment.

[Learn More About How Rakuten Works](https://www.rakuten.com/welcome.htm)

**How is Rakuten different?**

Whenever you click through a link to shop at a store (from social media or in promoted search results, for example), it’s likely that store is paying for your click. The difference in shopping with Rakuten is that when stores pay us, we pay you.

Even better:

*   Membership is free.
*   There’s no limit to how much Cash Back you can earn.
*   There are no rebate forms to mail in or points to count—we just send you your Cash Back, no strings attached.

**The Rakuten Mobile App**

Our 4-star Rakuten App ensures you’re always connected to savings.

To get started, visit your app store to find the Rakuten App and download it onto your mobile device. Once you’ve downloaded the app, you can activate a Rakuten Shopping Trip by clicking a Rakuten link.

When you’ve started a Shopping Trip, a window will open within the Rakuten App that lets you know that Cash Back has been activated. That window will then direct you to the store’s site to start shopping. If for any reason that store does not offer Cash Back through the mobile app, you will be notified in the activation window.

[Learn More About Rakuten Mobile Apps](https://www.rakuten.com/mobile.htm) 

**The Rakuten Cash Back Button**

Our Cash Back Button is an automated tool that proactively finds discounts and lets you earn Cash Back — without visiting Rakuten first.

To get started, first visit your browser store, search for the Rakuten Cash Back Button and download it. Once you’ve downloaded the Cash Back Button, you’ll see it in your browser bar.

Then, when you visit a store’s website, you’ll get a drop-down notification of the Cash Back and coupons offered at that store. Simply click on that drop down to start earning Cash Back, without interrupting your shopping.

You can also activate Cash Back through the Cash Back Button icon that appears on your browser bar by clicking on store cards, coupons and more. In both cases, you will be notified that Cash Back has been activated.

If for any reason, the store does not offer Cash Back through the Cash Back Button, the notification will not appear.

[Learn More About the Cash Back Button](https://www.rakuten.com/button.htm)

**In-Store Cash Back**

Now you can enjoy Cash Back, even when you shop in a brick and mortar store.

To get started, link your credit or debit card to your Rakuten account. Then, when you find an In-Store Cash Back offer that interests you, simply activate it and shop in the store with that card.

https://www.rakuten.com/help/category/online-cash-back-26577737853715,"With Rakuten, you can earn on almost everything. If you didn’t earn Cash Back and think you should have, or didn’t get the amount you expected, keep reading to find out why it can happen and how to fix it.

Make sure the item was not excluded from Cash Back

Some stores exclude certain items, categories or brands from earning Cash Back. These are called exclusions. To check exclusions, search for the store on rakuten.com and click the name on the left side of the results. This will take you to the store page where you can see Cash Back Terms & Exclusions. Tip: Be sure to check exclusions before you purchase to make sure you earn Cash Back!

Check if the item category was eligible at the store you purchased from

Stores can also set different Cash Back rates depending on the item category. If you didn’t receive the Cash Back amount you expected, check to see if the store set a different rate for the item you purchased. This info can be found on the store page. Search for the store on rakuten.com and click the name on the left side of the results to visit the store page where you can see Cash Back Categories.

Did you use a coupon code from another site?

Using coupon codes that are not listed on Rakuten may void Cash Back. To be safe, stick to codes provided by Rakuten.

Did you cancel your order?

If you canceled your order, it’s no longer eligible for Cash Back.

Did you make any returns?

If you returned all or part of your order, the store will let us know and we will adjust your Cash Back accordingly.

Avoid using other browser extensions and coupon sites

Going to other sites, especially ones that offer shopping rewards and coupons, can void Cash Back.

Stick to one browser tab if you start your shopping from rakuten.com

To be safe, complete your order on the tab that opened from rakuten.com at the beginning of your shopping session. If you complete your purchase in a different tab or window, we may be unable to link your purchase to your Rakuten account.

Re-activate Cash Back if you’ve been away from your computer

If your shopping session is idle for too long, Cash Back can become deactivated. Also, be sure to activate Cash Back before you add anything to your cart--some stores don’t allow us to link a purchase to your Rakuten account if items were added to your cart before you activated Cash Back.

Use the extension? Make sure you activated Cash Back

If you use our browser extension, activate Cash Back before you start shopping. If you don’t see the Activate Cash Back button, then that store may not be available for the extension. You can try activating Cash Back from Rakuten.com. [Learn more about stores and the Button extension](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/why-some-stores-are-not-available-with-the-cash-back-button-360002117287).

Some stores take longer to confirm your Cash Back

The time it takes for Cash Back to be confirmed depends on several factors, including the store, store policy, reporting schedule, exclusions and returns. For travel, Cash Back will be added after travel is completed.

Try these tips to make sure you’re set up for shopping success:

1.  **Use a compatible browser**. Rakuten is compatible with Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
2.  **Adjust the security settings in your browser**. Clear your browser’s cache and cookies, and make sure you allow cookies on http://rakuten.com
3.  **Use the Rakuten App on your mobile device**. You can install it for free on your iOS or Android device. [Get the App](https://www.rakuten.com/mobile.htm).
4.  **Add the Rakuten filter list if you use an ad blocker like uBlock or AdBlock Plus**. Ad blockers can cause Cash Back tracking issues, and the filter list helps us to determine your Cash Back eligibility. [Get more info about the filter list and install it](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/software-or-settings-preventing-cash-back-360002100568).

When you shop at participating local stores and pay with your eligible linked card, you’ll automatically earn Cash Back on qualifying purchases. Cash Back will typically be added to your Rakuten account within seven days of your purchase. If you’re using a debit card for purchase, do not enter your PIN and process the payment as credit.

Do I need to upload a receipt when I make a purchase?

No, you don’t need to upload a receipt to earn Cash Back. Simply pay with the credit card that has your in-store offer. We do recommend that you keep your receipt in the rare event that you do not receive Cash Back as expected. We’ll need your receipt to verify your transaction.

How do I know my credit card information is secure?

Rakuten takes your privacy and security very seriously. Your credit card data is safely stored in a secure, encrypted environment that has been certified as compliant by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI). Visit PCI’s site to [learn more about PCI compliance](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).

Do all purchases qualify for In-Store Cash Back?

Most in-store purchases at participating merchants are eligible for In-Store Cash Back. However, some stores may exclude certain products or categories from eligibility. For example, some merchants may not reward In-Store Cash Back for gift-card purchases or purchases within certain departments, such as pharmacy or automotive. Be sure to review any exclusions in the In-Store Cash Back offer details for each offer you add. Rakuten reserves the right to deduct Cash Back from your account if we determine that you made a purchase for an ineligible product or category.

Can I earn In-Store Cash Back for online purchases or orders placed at stores using their online ordering system?

No. Rakuten In-Store Cash Back offers are valid only for purchases made in physical stores when you check out via a store register. You can still enjoy Cash Back for qualifying online purchases when you start your shopping trip at Rakuten.com.

General Info

What type of credit cards can I use?

Rakuten In-Store Cash Back works with most American Express, Mastercard or Visa credit cards. Exceptions include Macy’s American Express cards, corporate and purchasing cards, Health Savings Account cards, Flexible Spending Account cards, government-administered prepaid cards (including EBT cards), insurance prepaid cards and Visa Buxx. Diners Club and Discover cards are not eligible for In-Store Cash Back at this time.

Can I earn In-Store Cash Back when using a mobile payment method such as Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay?

We strongly recommend using only physical credit cards for In-Store Cash Back purchases since we do not consistently receive mobile wallet transaction details from American Express, Mastercard or Visa. Without that transaction information, we cannot give you Cash Back.

Can I use my debit card to earn In-Store Cash Back?

It is recommended that you use an eligible American Express, Mastercard or Visa credit card. If you choose to use your debit card, do not enter your PIN at checkout. Instead, select “credit” instead of “debit” when your card is swiped or inserted, which means you will sign a receipt instead of entering your PIN. If you use your PIN for debit, Rakuten will not get your transaction information and you will not be eligible for Cash Back.

Why can’t I use my Diners Club and Discover cards?

We’re working to add more payment card options for use with In-Store Cash Back. We’ll let you know when we other payment options become eligible.

Can I use my store credit card for In-Store Cash Back?

Rakuten In-Store Cash Back is added to your balance when American Express, Mastercard or VISA report your purchase to us. Unfortunately, most store cards, even if they have a major credit card logo, are processed through the store’s bank and not the major credit card networks. This prevents us from being able to provide Cash Back on these transactions.

Can I use a credit card issued outside of the United States to earn In-Store Cash Back?

Only cards issued in the United States are eligible to earn Cash Back at participating stores in the United States.

How many cards can I enroll for In-Store Cash Back?

You can enroll as many credit cards as you like. There is no limit to the number of eligible American Express, Mastercard or Visa cards that can be added to your Rakuten account to earn In-Store Cash Back.

Can I earn In-Store Cash Back for purchases made via phone?

No. Rakuten In-Store Cash Back offers are valid only for purchases made in person at physical stores. Orders placed via phone (whether to a merchant’s call center or to a specific store location) are not eligible for In-Store Cash Back.

Can I earn In-Store Cash Back while shopping outside of the United States?

In-Store Cash Back is currently available only for in-store purchases at participating merchant locations in the 50 states of the United States.

Does Rakuten In-Store Cash Back cost extra?

Absolutely not. Rakuten In-Store Cash Back is offered to all Rakuten members for no extra cost.

Adding Offers

How do I add an offer to my credit card?

Once you link an eligible credit card to your account, go to [In-Store Cash Back](https://www.rakuten.com/in-store.htm) to view all available in-store offers. Find an offer and select “Add Offer” to add it to all cards you have enrolled for Rakuten In-Store Cash Back.

When I add an offer to my card, do I get In-Store Cash Back for all future purchases at the store?

No. For some offers, you may make additional qualifying purchases within a 24-hour window following your initial redemption, but, for others, the offer is only good for a single redemption. Check “See Details” on the In-Store Cash Back site to determine the rules for a specific offer. After that time, you must re-add the offer to your card to earn Cash Back.

How many times can I add an offer?

If there is a limit on the number of times you can add an Rakuten In-Store Cash Back offer, it will be in the specific offer’s details. Select “See Details” for an offer to determine whether there is a limit per person. For example, if an offer has a limit per person of three, then you can link the offer up to three times and redeem it to earn Cash Back on three separate qualifying purchases.

Do offers expire?

Yes. Link expiration varies by store, so please check “See Details” on the In-Store Cash Back site to determine the rules for a specific offer. If the offer is no longer linked to your card, you will not receive Cash Back for your purchase. We recommend reconfirming your link status before you shop.

If I make a purchase before I add an offer, will I still get Cash Back?

Unfortunately, no. To earn Cash Back, you must add offers to your eligible American Express, Mastercard or Visa credit card before you make an in-store purchase.

Redeeming Offers

How do I redeem an In-Store Cash Back offer?

Once you add an offer to your eligible American Express, Mastercard or Visa credit card, simply use that card to make an in-store purchase that meets the terms and conditions of the offer. Remember, if you use your debit card to redeem an offer, do not enter your PIN. You must use your signature in order for Rakuten to be notified of the transaction.

Do I need to present anything at the time of purchase?

No. That’s the best part! With Rakuten In-Store Cash Back, there are no coupons to clip, no vouchers to print and nothing extra to present to the store at the time of purchase. Just remember to use a credit card that you that has your added offer.

Do offers expire?

Yes, merchant offers expire. Expiration dates are specific to each offer and may be found by selecting “See Details” on the offer. You will not qualify for Cash Back on any purchase made after the offer expiration date.

What happens if an offer expires and I haven’t redeemed it?

When an offer that is added to one of your cards expires, it will be automatically removed.

How will I know if I’ve successfully redeemed an offer?

Rakuten will send you an email or Rakuten App notification when we learn of your in-store purchase, typically within 24 hours. Cash Back earned from In-Store Cash Back offers will be added to your [Cash Back Balance](https://www.rakuten.com/pending-cash-back.htm) in My Account, along with all the other Cash Back you’ve earned.

When will Cash Back be added to my account?

Cash Back will be added to your account after the store confirms your purchase. The time it takes for Cash Back to be confirmed depends on several factors, including the store, store policy, reporting schedule, exclusions and returns.

Do I need to keep my receipts?

We recommend that you do keep receipts. If the Cash Back does not automatically report to your account, we will need to see your receipt to resolve the issue.

Can I remove my credit card from my Rakuten account after making a purchase?

Cash Back will not post to your account if your credit card is not linked in your Account. If you wish to remove your credit card, you will need to wait until after Cash Back has posted to your account.

What percentage of Cash Back will I earn? Do Cash Back rates change during the offer period?

When using In-Store Cash Back, you will earn the amount of Cash Back that is advertised on the date you make your purchase. For example, if you add an offer when the Cash Back rate was 4%, but made your purchase during a 2x Cash Back promotion, you will earn the promotional rate of 8%. Alternatively, if you add an offer at the promotional rate of 8% but make your purchase once it has returned to 4%, you will earn the 4% Cash Back rate. If you add an offer during a promotional period, we recommend you shop before it ends so you can get more Cash Back."

How does it work?

To participate, you’ll need to opt in. You can also do this in your [Account Settings](https://www.rakuten.com/account-settings.htm).

1.1 or earlier of the License, but not also under the terms of a

Secondary License.

1.6. “Executable Form”

otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the

outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2\. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,

non-exclusive license:

a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

part of a Larger Work; and

b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for

sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions

or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become

effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes

such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this

License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution

or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section

2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s

modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its

Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor

Version); or

c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its

Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or

logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the

notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License

(see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted

under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions

are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the

rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable

copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in

Section 2.1.

3\. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any

Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the

terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form

of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how

they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or

restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,

as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the

Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by

reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost

of distribution to the recipient; and

b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,

or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for

the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’

rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,

provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the

Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software

with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered

Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits

You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of

such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at

their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of

either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including

copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations

of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered

Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent

required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,

indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered

Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf

of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such

warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You

alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any

liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,

indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional

disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any

jurisdiction.

4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License

with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial

order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License

to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code

they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all

distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the

extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be

sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to

understand it.

5\. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You

fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,

then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor

are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor

explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,

if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some

reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an

ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by

some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of

non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become

compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent

infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,

and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or

indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and

all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License

shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user

license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been

validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to

termination shall survive termination.

6\. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without

warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,

without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,

merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire

risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.

Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any

Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or

correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this

License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License

except under this disclaimer.

7\. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including

negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who

distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any

character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of

goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been

informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability

shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such

party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or

consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8\. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of

a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business

and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without

reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall

prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9\. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter

hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such

provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it

enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a

contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe

this License against a Contributor.

10\. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section

10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a

distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of

the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or

under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license

steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to

create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified

version of this License if you rename the license and remove any

references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such

modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the

notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

This Source Code Form is subject to the

terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.

2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not

distributed with this file, You can

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then

You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant

directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

This Source Code Form is “Incompatible

With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by

the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

(an example is provided in the Appendix below).

""Derivative Works"" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

""Contribution"" shall mean any work of authorship, including

the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

as of the date such litigation is filed.

4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

stating that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its

distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and

wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

the conditions stated in this License.

5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,

WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or

Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,

acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations

and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such

obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole

responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to

\--------------------------------

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,

non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer

for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its

Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution

become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first

distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under

this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the

distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.

Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a

Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;

or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's

modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its

Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor

Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of

its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,

or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with

the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this

License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if

permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its

Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights

to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under

applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other

equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted

in Section 2.1.

3\. Responsibilities

\-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any

Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under

the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source

Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this

License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not

attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code

Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code

Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of

the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code

Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more

than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this

License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the

license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter

the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,

provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for

the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered

Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the

Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this

License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software

under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of

the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered

Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary

License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices

(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,

or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of

the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to

the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,

indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered

Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on

behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any

such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by

You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any

liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,

indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional

disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any

jurisdiction.

4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

\---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this

License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to

statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with

the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)

describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must

be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered

Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute

or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a

recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5\. Termination

\--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically

if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become

compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular

Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such

Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an

ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the

non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have

come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular

Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor

notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the

first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License

from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after

Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent

infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,

counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version

directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to

You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section

2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all

end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which

have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License

prior to termination shall survive termination.

https://www.rakuten.com/help/category/company-information-115001466388,"Welcome to Rakuten, the best way to earn Cash Back and find deep discounts when you shop. Since 1997, Rakuten has helped shape the way people shop online. We acquired Ebates in 2014 and have grown to over 12 million members to remain the largest, free member-based savings programs in the U.S. To date, our members have earned over $1 billion in Cash Back.

**How does Rakuten work?**

Rakuten saves you money by using a simple business model: Stores pay Rakuten a commission for sending our members to shop at their websites. Rakuten then splits that commission with you, in the form of Cash Back.

To earn Cash Back:

1.  Join Rakuten: It’s free and only requires an email address and a password.
2.  Start a shopping trip with Rakuten by clicking on one of our links (on our site, in an email or in our mobile app, for example).
3.  You’ll be notified that Cash Back has been activated, and then just shop as you normally would.

And that’s it! Once the store notifies us of your order, Cash Back will be added to your account. Then, every quarter, we send you your Cash Back as a Big Fat Check or PayPal payment.

[Learn More About How Rakuten Works](https://www.rakuten.com/welcome.htm)

**How is Rakuten different?**

Whenever you click through a link to shop at a store (from social media or in promoted search results, for example), it’s likely that store is paying for your click. The difference in shopping with Rakuten is that when stores pay us, we pay you.

Even better:

*   Membership is free.
*   There’s no limit to how much Cash Back you can earn.
*   There are no rebate forms to mail in or points to count—we just send you your Cash Back, no strings attached.

Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. dba Rakuten Rewards (“Company” or “we”) makes available shopping programs (“Programs”) through www.rakuten.com and related mobile and software applications (“Company Properties”) under these Terms and Conditions. Company is part of the Rakuten Group, which includes the affiliates and subsidiaries of our parent company, Rakuten Group, Inc., based in Tokyo, Japan.

**This Agreement constitutes a legally binding agreement between each individual who enrolls in any of the Programs (“Member”) or otherwise uses any one of the Company Properties. If you are a Member or use any of the Company Properties, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY All OF ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.**

**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DISCONTINUE PARTICIPATION IN AND USE OF THE PROGRAM(S) AND TERMINATE YOUR PROGRAM ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY.**

**YOU AGREE TO THE MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISIONS, DESCRIBED FULLY IN SECTION 4 BELOW, TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES WITH THE COMPANY, EXCEPT FOR THOSE MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL-CLAIMS COURT IN THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 23.2.**

**1\. CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

1.1 Company may at its discretion modify, update, add to, discontinue, remove or otherwise change these Terms and Conditions at any time. Each such modification will take immediate effect upon notification to you. Company may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms and Conditions, by website, email, regular mail, text message, in-app messaging, or other reasonable means now known or hereinafter developed.

1.2 Your continued use of the Company Property following any such notifications constitutes your acceptance of such modifications and your agreement to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to any modification of these Terms and Conditions, your sole remedy is to terminate your Account by accessing your Account’s Privacy Preferences. The most current version of these Terms and Conditions will be available on our website and supersedes previous versions.

To become a Member, you must be at least 18 years old and provide your email address and password for Company to create your Program account (“Account”). Each person is limited to one Account.

Any and all information collected from you shall be subject to our [Privacy Policy](http://www.rakuten.com/privacy), which is hereby incorporated by reference.

**3\. INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

3.1 We would like an opportunity to address your concerns without a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Company, You agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by submitting your request through our [Member Services](https://www.rakuten.com/help/other-questions) page. Please be sure to select “It’s something else” under Topics in your request. We will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you in writing via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of submission through this form, you or Company may bring a formal proceeding.

**4\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

4.1 You and Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement, Company’s business, any of the Programs or the Company Properties, and relationship with you, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate includes any claims against Company’s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of Company. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding in state or federal court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.

4.2 All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration. You further agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.

4.3 **CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND COMPANY ALSO AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION**. This means that neither you nor Company can seek to assert class or representative claims against each other either in court or in arbitration and no relief can be awarded on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator also may not consolidate or join another person’s claim with your claim or issue an order that would achieve the same result. You and the Company further agree that if the provisions of this paragraph, known as the “Class Action Waiver,” are found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entire provision compelling arbitration shall be null and void.

4.4 To the extent possible under your local law, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules or pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”). The Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. If your claim in arbitration is for less than $10,000, Company will reimburse you for filing and arbitrator fees at the conclusion of the proceeding unless your claim is found to be frivolous by the arbitrator. The exclusive venue for any dispute or issue arising out of this Agreement shall be held in San Francisco County, California.

4.5 Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if we make any future, material change to this arbitration provision, you may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. DBA Rakuten Rewards, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, Attn: Rakuten Rewards Legal. Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which you have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.

4.6 This arbitration provision is optional. You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. dba Rakuten Rewards, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, Attn: Legal within thirty (30) calendar days of enrolling as a Member or accessing a Company Property for the first time.

4.7 Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.

**5\. PROGRAM LICENSE**

5.1 Subject to this Agreement, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sublicense) to access and use the Company Properties for your personal use to access the Program(s).

Company reserves the right to change, upgrade or discontinue the Program, any Company Property, and any feature of the Program or the Company Properties, at any time, with or without notice.

Multiple Accounts created under the Refer-A-Friend Program with the same name, address, email address or other identifying feature may be flagged as fraudulent referrals. Any failure to comply with this Agreement, any fraud or abuse relating to the accrual or receipt of Cash Back or other rewards and bonuses, or any misrepresentation of any information furnished to Company by you or anyone acting on your behalf may result in the termination of your Account and forfeiture of any accrued Cash Back rewards. If Company has any reason to suspect fraudulent activity is associated with your Account, Company reserves the right to delay or withhold payment of Cash Back. Any suspected or actual cases of fraud activity will be escalated and reviewed in accordance with our fraud process. Company decisions are final.

If you choose to participate in our referral programs, you represent and warrant that you have a personal relationship with your referral and that you are authorized to share their information with Company for the purpose of Company sending a communication to invite them to join the Services. If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information through our referral service and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact our member services at [https://www.rakuten.com/help/other-questions](https://www.rakuten.com/help/other-questions).

**3\. Disclosure of Information**

We may disclose the below-specified categories of information for our business or commercial purposes, including the following:

**Disclosure to Our Service Providers**

We may disclose all categories of your collected personal information as necessary with our third-party service providers (which may include Company affiliates) who perform various business operations, solely for our benefit or on our behalf, under our instructions and in compliance with appropriate contractual, technical and organizational security measures to protect your data from unauthorized use, retention, or disclosure. For example, we may partner with other companies to provide you member support services, authentication services, prevent fraud on our Services, process payments, administer our promotions, referral programs, sweepstakes, and surveys, perform analytics, maintain the accuracy of our databases, deliver direct marketing and communications, limit delivery of repetitive or unnecessary marketing or communications, facilitate your gift card purchases, fulfill your product purchases, place and fulfill your takeout orders, and administer your rewards or payments.

**Disclosure to Our Business Partners**

We work with various types of third-party business partners to offer you our Cash Back shopping Services. We may disclose the following types of information with the following types of Business Partners:

**Affiliate Partners**

When you click on a link to a merchant site presented on our Services to start your Cash Back shopping, you evidence your intent to interact with that business through our Services, and thereby are directing us to disclose certain information about you (including the link you clicked in our Services and a unique ID assigned to track that your shopping originated from our Services) to an affiliate network to properly account for your purchases with a merchant. For a small number of merchants that do not utilize an affiliate network, this information is provided directly to the merchant. The Affiliate Partner will collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of our Services in relation to the merchant site, products, or offers. Our Affiliate Partners collect this information to track the shopping trip, but some of them may also use this information to measure performance, contribute it to their own user profiles and/or combine it with information they collect elsewhere, which they may make available for use by their other business clients. In such cases, our disclosure to certain of these Affiliate Partners could be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information as those terms are defined under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and the opt-out we offer to consumers in Section 5, below, would signal these Affiliate Partners to not collect or use your information from our Services except as necessary to validate and provide your Cash Back.

In addition, to the limited extent that we target direct marketing to you or personalize the offers you see in our Services based on the profile data we compile from your behavior tracked via our Services, for the direct benefit of a particular merchant, this marketing or personalization may also be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for the purposes of “targeted advertising” of your personal information. In this circumstance, the opt-out we provide in Section 5, below, would cover this type of targeted marketing and personalization. We may use information we collect about you in combination with information about you from current and prospective merchant partners to test and analyze how our Services help merchants and business partners. The information we disclose to and receive from a merchant or business partner to effectuate this analysis may include online shopping identifiers (such as shopping ID’s, order ID’s), a hashed email address, and Commercial Information (such as whether a purchase was made and the corresponding order value). We may use the results from these tests in an aggregated and deidentified manner to improve our Services and to market our Services to merchants and business clients. You may opt out of our disclosure of your information to these certain third parties for this purpose in accordance with Section 5, below.

**Referral Marketing Partners**

In order to expand your options to sign up for our Services and start your Cash Back shopping from third-party sites where you learn about our Services, we contract with certain referral marketing business partners to enable that functionality, which may require that we disclose certain data about you to them. For example, if you are referred to our Services from a business partner’s websites, we may provide that partner with information about your sign up to validate the referral and activate your Services account access from the partner’s site. In addition, we may disclose information about whether you have made a purchase with us recently and whether you have installed our mobile app or browser extension so that the partner can personalize their email and site content to you. This information disclosure about your behavior in our Services may be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, so we provide an opt-out opportunity in Section 5, below.

If you signed up for cash back through our sister company, ShopStyle, Inc. (“ShopStyle”), we may provide ShopStyle with certain transaction information so that you can view your rewards summary on www.shopstyle.com. We may also place a cookie on your device so that you can continue your cash back shopping through www.shopstyle.com without having to sign in to our Services each time. For more information on how ShopStyle processes personal information, please visit [www.shopstyle.com/privacy.](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/www.shopstyle.com/privacy)

**Financial Partners**

For the purposes of providing you additional redemption options for your Cash Back and to market our co-branded credit cards to you, we may disclose your collected information, including Identifiers, to financial business partners, which may include Rakuten Group Companies. If you select loyalty points or other alternative methods of receiving your Cash Back, you are directing us to disclose your personal information, as necessary, to the relevant financial partner to facilitate that transaction. If you indicate that you would like to receive information about our co-branded credit cards from our financial partner(s), you are also directing us to disclose your information to such parties to enable them to provide that information.

We may also disclose personal information about you to our financial partners in order to facilitate their marketing purposes and in some instances for the financial partner to directly send marketing to you. This could be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and you may opt-out of this disclosure for partner marketing in Section 5, below.

**Disclosure to Digital Advertising Providers**

To provide us with targeted advertising and marketing services, we partner with certain third parties that automatically collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of the Services, such as your browsing history, IP address, pages viewed, and links clicked, so that they can use this information to serve you ads for our Services on other sites you visit. Some of these third parties may also use this collected information to draw inferences about you for their own purposes or separately collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites (in addition to our Services) to help predict your preferences and to display (and enable other third parties to display) ads to you that are more likely to be of interest to you. You have the right to opt out of our sharing of your information with certain third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral or targeted advertising. To exercise this right, you can opt-out via the instructions in Section 5, below. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of data and does not include further use of data by third parties. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising in general, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

**Disclosure to Other Rakuten Group Companies**

We work closely with our affiliated businesses and companies within the Rakuten Group and disclose your personal information for our internal business administration. Some of our Service Providers and Business Partners to whom we disclose personal information, as described above, may include other Rakuten Group Companies. We may also disclose information in the categories of Identifiers (email address), Commercial Information (product metrics), and Internet and other Network Activity to our affiliates within the Rakuten Group for those corporate affiliates to analyze and monitor usage and trends to improve their services and websites and for strategic planning purposes at the Rakuten Group level. Our opt-out and delete request functionality will serve to remove you from these disclosures.

**Disclosure for Legal Purposes**

We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) in response to subpoenas or other legal processes or if, in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required or permitted by law without a specific disclosure; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to enforce our terms and conditions or other policies applicable to our Services; and (iv) to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of Company or any third party.

**In Relation to Business Asset Transfers**

We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to any third party in connection with, or during confidential negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession) or any other type of acquisition of all or any portion of Company assets, conveyance or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company. In such event, the acquiring company would be contractually required to use your collected information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law or to provide prior notice to you of any new or materially changed practices.

In addition to the above listed disclosures, we may also disclose aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used by recipients to identify you.

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/google-api-user-data-policy,"## Google API Disclosure

Rakuten uses Google APIs when you use Google to sign in to your Rakuten account. Our use of information from the Google APIs will be in compliance with the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements."
https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/advertising-disclosure,"**How Do We Make Money?**

Our business is based on a simple idea: When you follow our links to visit a store, that store pays us a commission on whatever you buy during your visit. We then share that commission with you, our members, as Cash Back.

In other words, retailers pay to partner with us because we send shoppers to their websites or brick-and-mortar stores. They may also pay us to help grow their brand. That means we might feature them on our website, in emails, etc. Because of these partnerships, members like you benefit by earning Cash Back and getting great offers.

To sum it up, we help retailers succeed and, at the same time, help our members save money.

**What does it mean when Rakuten states that a cash back percentage ""was"" a certain amount?**

Stores pay us a commission for sending our members to their websites, and we share it with you as cash back. When a store joins Rakuten, we set a cash back percentage for that store (a ""base cash back percentage""). We work with our merchant partners to offer increased cash back from time to time to our members. An increased cash back percentage is often promoted alongside a ""was %"". The ""was %"" describes the ""base cash back percentage,"" but does not necessarily or always reflect the most recent cash back percentage or the most common cash back percentage for a store. The cash back percentage for any store is not a fixed percentage and is subject to change.

1.  Start at Rakuten and choose a store. You can use our website, mobile app, or browser extension.
2.  Activate Cash Back to start shopping. Once you make an eligible purchase, we’ll add Cash Back to your account.
3.  Get paid! Add your address and get paid via check or PayPal.

That’s all you have to do.

Once a store confirms your purchase with us, we add Cash Back to your account and notify you via email or push notification. The time it takes for Cash Back to be confirmed depends on several factors, including the store, store policy, reporting schedule, exclusions and returns.

We’ll send your first payment as soon as 15 days after your first purchase. After that, we’ll send your Cash Back payment [every three months](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/help/article/getting-your-rakuten-cash-back-payments-360002117667). If there’s any Cash Back pending, we’ll carry it over to your next payment.

Remember, you can only earn Cash Back if you start shopping at Rakuten. If you make a purchase without going through Rakuten, we won't be able to reward you with Cash Back. You can always try our browser extension which will notify you about Cash Back deals when you’re on a website. It’ll even find coupons for you!

**The Rakuten Mobile App**

Our 4-star Rakuten App ensures you’re always connected to savings.

To get started, visit your app store to find the Rakuten App and download it onto your mobile device. Once you’ve downloaded the app, you can activate a Rakuten Shopping Trip by clicking a Rakuten link.

When you’ve started a Shopping Trip, a window will open within the Rakuten App that lets you know that Cash Back has been activated. That window will then direct you to the store’s site to start shopping. If for any reason that store does not offer Cash Back through the mobile app, you will be notified in the activation window.

[Learn More About Rakuten Mobile Apps](https://www.rakuten.com/mobile.htm) 

**The Rakuten Cash Back Button**

Our Cash Back Button is an automated tool that proactively finds discounts and lets you earn Cash Back — without visiting Rakuten first.

To get started, first visit your browser store, search for the Rakuten Cash Back Button and download it. Once you’ve downloaded the Cash Back Button, you’ll see it in your browser bar.

Then, when you visit a store’s website, you’ll get a drop-down notification of the Cash Back and coupons offered at that store. Simply click on that drop down to start earning Cash Back, without interrupting your shopping.

You can also activate Cash Back through the Cash Back Button icon that appears on your browser bar by clicking on store cards, coupons and more. In both cases, you will be notified that Cash Back has been activated.

If for any reason, the store does not offer Cash Back through the Cash Back Button, the notification will not appear.

[Learn More About the Cash Back Button](https://www.rakuten.com/button.htm)

**In-Store Cash Back**

Now you can enjoy Cash Back, even when you shop in a brick and mortar store.

To get started, link your credit or debit card to your Rakuten account. Then, when you find an In-Store Cash Back offer that interests you, simply activate it and shop in the store with that card.

**Where to Find Your Cash Back**

You can visit [Cash Back Balance](https://www.rakuten.com/pending-cash-back.htm) to verify that you earned Cash Back on a purchase. We usually can’t report Cash Back immediately at the time of purchase because it takes time for the store to notify us that you placed an order. Depending on the store, this can take from a few hours to several days.

Once the store confirms that you’ve made a purchase, we’ll add Cash Back to your account and notify you. At that point, the amount will be viewable in [Cash Back Balance](https://www.rakuten.com/pending-cash-back.htm).

Your purchases will earn Cash Back only if you start a Shopping Trip with Rakuten. If you don’t click on a Rakuten link to start a Shopping Trip, we have no way of showing the store that you are a Rakuten member.

**Tracking your Shopping Trips**

Sometimes you’ll start a Shopping Trip and not make a purchase; however, we’ll still have it recorded in your account for up to three months, should you need to refer to it. This number can come in handy if you ever think you have not earned Cash Back for a purchase and you want to ask Member Services to look into it.

You can always visit [My Account](https://www.rakuten.com/my-account.htm) to view your Shopping Trip history.

**About repeat Shopping Trips**

To earn Cash Back, you must click through a Rakuten link every time you shop. If you click through Rakuten and make a purchase, then return to that store later to make a second purchase, you must start another Rakuten shopping trip in order to earn Cash Back.

If you use multiple windows on your browser, the window in which you shop at the store must have come from a Rakuten link.

**What’s a browser extension?**

A browser extension is a small software program that’s added to your browser to provide additional features or shortcuts for sites you use often. Some well-known browser extensions are ad blockers, or the Pinterest Save Button.

**Is it safe to use?**

Yes. We do not use the Cash Back Button to install any other software on your computer. It cannot harm your computer, will not impact your browsing and will not collect and share your personal information. Its only purpose is to help you earn Cash Back and get the best deals as easily as possible!

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/referafriend-program-faq-360002117087,"What is the Refer-A-Friend Program?

Rakuten offers cash bonuses to our members for spreading the word about earning Cash Back. If someone you refer signs up for Rakuten and makes a qualifying purchase, you can both earn a reward! The purchase requirement and reward amount can vary, but the most current promotion can always be found on the [Refer-A-Friend](https://www.rakuten.com/referral/default.do) page.

How does the program work?

Rakuten members are each assigned a unique link, which can be found by signing in to Rakuten and visiting the [Refer-A-Friend](https://www.rakuten.com/referral/default.do) page. Simply send your link to friends via email, text or social media. If they sign up via your link and make a qualifying purchase, you both earn your reward.

What do my friends need to do?

To earn your referral bonus, your friend has to:

*   Sign up for Rakuten using your unique link or by providing the email for your Rakuten account at sign up. (This is how we’ll know who sent them!)
*   Make a purchase (or a few) that qualifies for Cash Back within the specified timeframe of the bonus.

When will I receive my bonus?

Generally, you'll receive your referral bonus within 60 days of your referral’s qualifying purchase.

What does an expired referral mean?

An expired referral means that you invited a friend Rakuten, but they didn’t complete a qualifying purchase in time.

What does a pending referral mean?

A pending referral means that your friend joined Rakuten but hasn’t made a qualifying purchase yet. If they do, we’ll update the bonus status to earned.

What does an earned referral mean?

A earned referral means that your friend joined Rakuten and made a qualifying purchase. Once you get your referral bonus in a Big Fat Check, we’ll update the status to paid.

Why did I receive a different bonus amount than expected?

Bonus amounts are subject to change from time to time. The person who was referred to join will get the bonus that was available on day of sign up.

Can I see my activity?

To see if your friends have signed up and/or qualified you for a reward, visit “My Referral Activity” on the [Refer-A-Friend](https://www.rakuten.com/referral/default.do) page.

How many friends can I invite?

The more, the merrier! You can invite all the friends, family members and coworkers you know. Who doesn’t love Cash Back? Just know that in order to receive credit, members have to be new to Rakuten.

Will my friends receive unsolicited emails?

We respect your friends’ privacy and will only send email invitations to them at your request. Once your friends join, they’ll be able to adjust their email preferences.

**What are the changes to the Refer-A-Friend program for members outside of the United States?**

As of October 01, 2020, the Rakuten Refer-A-Friend program will no longer be available to residents outside of the 50 United States, D.C., and Canada. Both referrers and referees must be located in 50 United States, D.C., or Canada in order to qualify for a referral or sign up bonus.

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/ebates-is-now-rakuten-everything-you-need-to-know-360002117807,"We’ve changed our name from Ebates to Rakuten. Aside from the new name and logo, our member experience is virtually unchanged. Here are some common questions and answers related to this change.

Is this really Ebates?

Yes! Ebates has been a Rakuten company since 2014. The same team that brought you Ebates is part of the Rakuten family.

What has changed?

Almost nothing, except that in places you’re used to seeing the name Ebates, you now see Rakuten instead.

*   The icons and logos have been updated on our website, app and browser extension.
*   Our URL has changed. If you navigate to ebates.com, you’re redirected to the new version of our site at rakuten.com.
*   Your emails should now be coming from Rakuten and Rakuten Member Services.
*   If you receive your payments via Big Fat Check, it will have a new look with the Rakuten logo.
*   If you receive your payments via PayPal, it will come from Rakuten.

How does this affect me as a member?

The name change should have no effect on how you use our service. Everything else, including Cash Back, is the same as before.

Why did the name change?

We discuss the thinking behind our name change and how it affects members on our New Brand Announcement page. [View the Announcement](https://www.rakuten.com/new-brand).

What does the name “Rakuten” mean?

Rakuten is Japanese for “optimism.”

Are you a Japanese company now?

Rakuten is a multinational corporation with businesses all over the world. Our Americas Regional Headquarters is located in San Mateo, California, and we employ 2,500 people across the U.S. For more information, please visit [our global corporate site](https://global.rakuten.com/corp/about/).

Why do some members still see the Ebates site and app? Can I switch back to Ebates?

We’re moving Ebates members to the new Rakuten site one group at a time, so that the name change can occur in an orderly fashion. This means some members will still experience the Ebates version of our site while the transition is underway. When the transition is complete, all members will be upgraded to the new Rakuten site.

Do I have to do anything?

You shouldn’t need to, but there are a few things that might make things more convenient:

*   If you’ve bookmarked ebates.com, update your bookmarks to rakuten.com.
*   Add Rakuten and Rakuten Member Services to your approved sender list in email. This will help prevent your Cash Back notifications from getting filtered out of your inbox.
*   Keep your app up-to-date.
*   Advanced: Are you using a pop-up blocker? If you’ve whitelisted Ebates to allow Cash Back shopping to work with your blocker, you’ll need to update those settings to add Rakuten as a trusted site.

I’ve referred people to Ebates. Will I still get paid?

Yes! You’re eligible to earn referral bonuses whether the members you refer purchase through the Ebates or Rakuten service."

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/how-in-store-cash-back-works-360002117467,"You can earn Cash Back shopping in person at select stores, just like you do online.

Here’s how to get started with earning In-Store Cash Back:

1.  **Link a credit card to your Account.**
    
    [Link a card in your Account](https://www.rakuten.com/my-wallet.htm). You can earn in-store Cash Back with Visa, Mastercard and American Express.
    
2.  **Add the offer to your card.**
    
    Offers can only be used on a single purchase and are usually active for 45 days. Make sure to check offer details to see when the offer expires. The offer must be added to your linked credit card before making a purchase.
    
3.  **Go to the store and shop!**
    
    In-store Cash Back is only available for physical purchases made at the store. If you place an online purchase and pick up in-store, you will not earn in-store Cash Back.
    
4.  **Pay with your linked card to earn Cash Back.**
    
    Use your linked card when you’re purchasing in store.
    

**Debit cards MUST be run as credit to earn Cash Back in store.**

**Tips for maximizing your In-Store Cash Back:**

*   Re-add offers after you shop. Added offers are valid for one purchase only.
*   Use the App to add an offer while you’re in the store. You can also add Dining offers exclusively in the App. [Learn more about Dining](https://www.rakuten.com/dining)
*   Make sure push notifications are turned on in the App so you know about in-store Cash Back deals near you.

**Getting your In-Store Cash Back**

Cash Back will be added to your account after the store confirms your purchase. The time it takes for Cash Back to be confirmed depends on several factors, including the store, store policy, reporting schedule, exclusions and returns.

**Card safety and security**

We take your privacy and security very seriously. Your credit card data is safely stored in a secure, encrypted environment that has been certified as compliant by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI). You can learn more about PCI compliance at [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).

In cooperation with our stores, we provide you with specials and coupons that you can combine with cash back for maximum savings. We provide you with an extensive list of store specials and coupons. Please refer to the [Coupons & Specials page](https://www.rakuten.com/coupons) or the store search for these offers. If you choose to use coupons and specials that are not listed on www.ebates.com or www.rakuten.com, we cannot guarantee that you will be eligible to receive a Rakuten cash back reward on your purchases.

Furthermore, please be advised that coupons and special offers listed on www.ebates.com or www.rakuten.com are subject to change. Restrictions may apply. We try to present the most accurate offers but cannot make guarantees due to the time-sensitive nature of these promotions.

**What purchases are eligible for double cash back?**

Every day we pick at least one store and double the cash back on purchases for a twenty-four hour period only. To be eligible for double cash back, your purchase must be made during a shopping session that originates from a link from www.ebates.com or www.rakuten.com between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM PST on the day it has been selected by us, and make a purchase.

**Do all purchases qualify for cash back rewards?**

We cannot, however, give cash back for taxes, shipping, or any portion of a purchase that is paid for with gift certificates or a store credit. Any purchase of products and services in which the transaction is substantially completed by telephone does not qualify for cash back. In addition, a few specific stores place minor restrictions on cash back eligibility. If you'd like to know if a store has any restrictions or exceptions, please visit that store's page on our website. Note that store exceptions change regularly and we reserve the right to cancel or delay cash back payments when affiliated stores alter their policies or refuse to pay us a commission.

**What does “Coupons Only” and “No Discount” mean?**

When a store is dubbed “Coupons Only” or “No Discount”, you will not receive cash back on your purchases from that store. You can use the coupon codes posted on www.ebates.com or www.rakuten.com to get great deals at Coupons Only stores by clicking through the links on www.ebates.com or www.rakuten.com and using the coupon codes at check out.

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/why-some-stores-are-not-available-with-the-cash-back-button-360002117287,"We encourage all stores to offer Cash Back through the Cash Back Button, but a small number of stores don’t participate fully or at all.

Some stores offer Cash Back but don’t allow the Button to show a notification on their site. In this case, you won’t see a reminder to activate Cash Back when shopping on that site but you can still activate Cash Back through the Button. If the Button icon in your browser’s toolbar is flashing red, select the icon, then select Activate Cash Back. When the icon turns blue, you’ve activated Cash Back and you’re ready to shop!

Other stores don't offer Cash Back at all through the Button, so you won’t be able to activate Cash Back directly on the site. You can always check [rakuten.com](https://www.rakuten.com/) to see if you can earn Cash Back by starting your shopping from the Rakuten website, instead of using the Button."
https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/software-or-settings-preventing-cash-back-360002100568,"Cash Back can only be activated if we know where you’re shopping. Sometimes cookies, ad blockers and content blockers can prevent Cash Back from being activated.

**COOKIES**

If you’re using security or protection software, their settings must allow cookies from Rakuten and the stores where you shop. It’s how we know you’re shopping there, so you can earn Cash Back.

Here are a few tips to help you activate Cash Back:

**For firewall software, like Zone Alarm or Norton Internet Security:**

Turn off the ad-blocking option when you start shopping with Rakuten.

**For other browser extensions linked to shopping rewards or coupon sites:**

Turn off these when you start shopping with Rakuten. They may redirect your shopping trip from Rakuten and take credit for your order.

**For browsers in private or incognito mode:**

We recommend not using this setting since it prevents Rakuten from communicating with other stores and activating Cash Back.

**For those using a VPN:**

We recommend disabling your VPN while shopping since Rakuten cannot guarantee your Cash Back will be activated.

**For network level traffic blocking, like Bitdefender and Pi-hole:**

Try going to the settings of your software and create an exception for Rakuten.com.

**AD BLOCKING SOFTWARE**

Ad blockers block us from knowing where you’re shopping, so we can’t track your eligible orders for Cash Back.

**For AdBlock**

If Rakuten identifies this ad blocker, we’ll show you a message that asks you to Enable Cash Back. This will place Rakuten on a list that will allow you to shop and activate Cash Back.

If you still see ad blocker alerts after adding the filter, you can disable your ad blocker during your shopping trips, and then re-enable it after you’re done.

**For AdBlock Plus, uBlock Origin and all other ad blockers:**

To ensure we track your Cash Back, we recommend that you disable your ad blocker during your shopping trips, and then re-enable it after you’re done.

**CONTENT BLOCKERS ON MOBILE**

Content blockers on your mobile device block us from knowing where you’re shopping, so we can’t activate Cash Back.

To make sure Cash Back is activated, we recommend that you either shop with the Rakuten App or disable your content blockers while shopping.

To disable content blocking on your iOS device:

*   Go to Settings and select Safari
*   Select Content Blockers
*   Turn off all content blockers
*   Start your shopping trip from Rakuten again to make sure Cash Back is activated

When you’re done shopping, you can follow these same steps and turn on your content blocker.

We may disclose all categories of your collected personal information as necessary with our third-party service providers (which may include Company affiliates) who perform various business operations, solely for our benefit or on our behalf, under our instructions and in compliance with appropriate contractual, technical and organizational security measures to protect your data from unauthorized use, retention, or disclosure. For example, we may partner with other companies to provide you member support services, authentication services, prevent fraud on our Services, process payments, administer our promotions, referral programs, sweepstakes, and surveys, perform analytics, maintain the accuracy of our databases, deliver direct marketing and communications, limit delivery of repetitive or unnecessary marketing or communications, facilitate your gift card purchases, fulfill your product purchases, place and fulfill your takeout orders, and administer your rewards or payments.

**Disclosure to Our Business Partners**

We work with various types of third-party business partners to offer you our Cash Back shopping Services. We may disclose the following types of information with the following types of Business Partners:

**Affiliate Partners**

When you click on a link to a merchant site presented on our Services to start your Cash Back shopping, you evidence your intent to interact with that business through our Services, and thereby are directing us to disclose certain information about you (including the link you clicked in our Services and a unique ID assigned to track that your shopping originated from our Services) to an affiliate network to properly account for your purchases with a merchant. For a small number of merchants that do not utilize an affiliate network, this information is provided directly to the merchant. The Affiliate Partner will collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of our Services in relation to the merchant site, products, or offers. Our Affiliate Partners collect this information to track the shopping trip, but some of them may also use this information to measure performance, contribute it to their own user profiles and/or combine it with information they collect elsewhere, which they may make available for use by their other business clients. In such cases, our disclosure to certain of these Affiliate Partners could be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information as those terms are defined under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and the opt-out we offer to consumers in Section 5, below, would signal these Affiliate Partners to not collect or use your information from our Services except as necessary to validate and provide your Cash Back.

In addition, to the limited extent that we target direct marketing to you or personalize the offers you see in our Services based on the profile data we compile from your behavior tracked via our Services, for the direct benefit of a particular merchant, this marketing or personalization may also be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for the purposes of “targeted advertising” of your personal information. In this circumstance, the opt-out we provide in Section 5, below, would cover this type of targeted marketing and personalization. We may use information we collect about you in combination with information about you from current and prospective merchant partners to test and analyze how our Services help merchants and business partners. The information we disclose to and receive from a merchant or business partner to effectuate this analysis may include online shopping identifiers (such as shopping ID’s, order ID’s), a hashed email address, and Commercial Information (such as whether a purchase was made and the corresponding order value). We may use the results from these tests in an aggregated and deidentified manner to improve our Services and to market our Services to merchants and business clients. You may opt out of our disclosure of your information to these certain third parties for this purpose in accordance with Section 5, below.

**Referral Marketing Partners**

In order to expand your options to sign up for our Services and start your Cash Back shopping from third-party sites where you learn about our Services, we contract with certain referral marketing business partners to enable that functionality, which may require that we disclose certain data about you to them. For example, if you are referred to our Services from a business partner’s websites, we may provide that partner with information about your sign up to validate the referral and activate your Services account access from the partner’s site. In addition, we may disclose information about whether you have made a purchase with us recently and whether you have installed our mobile app or browser extension so that the partner can personalize their email and site content to you. This information disclosure about your behavior in our Services may be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, so we provide an opt-out opportunity in Section 5, below.

If you signed up for cash back through our sister company, ShopStyle, Inc. (“ShopStyle”), we may provide ShopStyle with certain transaction information so that you can view your rewards summary on www.shopstyle.com. We may also place a cookie on your device so that you can continue your cash back shopping through www.shopstyle.com without having to sign in to our Services each time. For more information on how ShopStyle processes personal information, please visit [www.shopstyle.com/privacy.](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/www.shopstyle.com/privacy)

**Financial Partners**

For the purposes of providing you additional redemption options for your Cash Back and to market our co-branded credit cards to you, we may disclose your collected information, including Identifiers, to financial business partners, which may include Rakuten Group Companies. If you select loyalty points or other alternative methods of receiving your Cash Back, you are directing us to disclose your personal information, as necessary, to the relevant financial partner to facilitate that transaction. If you indicate that you would like to receive information about our co-branded credit cards from our financial partner(s), you are also directing us to disclose your information to such parties to enable them to provide that information.

We may also disclose personal information about you to our financial partners in order to facilitate their marketing purposes and in some instances for the financial partner to directly send marketing to you. This could be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and you may opt-out of this disclosure for partner marketing in Section 5, below.

**Disclosure to Digital Advertising Providers**

To provide us with targeted advertising and marketing services, we partner with certain third parties that automatically collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of the Services, such as your browsing history, IP address, pages viewed, and links clicked, so that they can use this information to serve you ads for our Services on other sites you visit. Some of these third parties may also use this collected information to draw inferences about you for their own purposes or separately collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites (in addition to our Services) to help predict your preferences and to display (and enable other third parties to display) ads to you that are more likely to be of interest to you. You have the right to opt out of our sharing of your information with certain third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral or targeted advertising. To exercise this right, you can opt-out via the instructions in Section 5, below. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of data and does not include further use of data by third parties. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising in general, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

**Disclosure to Other Rakuten Group Companies**

We work closely with our affiliated businesses and companies within the Rakuten Group and disclose your personal information for our internal business administration. Some of our Service Providers and Business Partners to whom we disclose personal information, as described above, may include other Rakuten Group Companies. We may also disclose information in the categories of Identifiers (email address), Commercial Information (product metrics), and Internet and other Network Activity to our affiliates within the Rakuten Group for those corporate affiliates to analyze and monitor usage and trends to improve their services and websites and for strategic planning purposes at the Rakuten Group level. Our opt-out and delete request functionality will serve to remove you from these disclosures.

**Disclosure for Legal Purposes**

We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) in response to subpoenas or other legal processes or if, in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required or permitted by law without a specific disclosure; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to enforce our terms and conditions or other policies applicable to our Services; and (iv) to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of Company or any third party.

**In Relation to Business Asset Transfers**

We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to any third party in connection with, or during confidential negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession) or any other type of acquisition of all or any portion of Company assets, conveyance or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company. In such event, the acquiring company would be contractually required to use your collected information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law or to provide prior notice to you of any new or materially changed practices.

In addition to the above listed disclosures, we may also disclose aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used by recipients to identify you.

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/what-is-an-rakuten-shopping-trip-360002100588,"When you’ve clicked on a Rakuten link to earn Cash Back at a store — on Rakuten.com, in the Rakuten App or with the Rakuten Cash Back Button — you’ve created a Rakuten Shopping Trip. Your Shopping Trip is assigned a unique number, which we use to verify your purchase with the store.

Your purchases will earn Cash Back only if you start a Shopping Trip with Rakuten. If you don’t click on a Rakuten link to start a Shopping Trip, we have no way of showing the store that you are a Rakuten member.

**Tracking your Shopping Trips**

Sometimes you’ll start a Shopping Trip and not make a purchase; however, we’ll still have it recorded in your account for up to three months, should you need to refer to it. This number can come in handy if you ever think you have not earned Cash Back for a purchase and you want to ask Member Services to look into it.

You can always visit [My Account](https://www.rakuten.com/my-account.htm) to view your Shopping Trip history.

**About repeat Shopping Trips**

To earn Cash Back, you must click through a Rakuten link every time you shop. If you click through Rakuten and make a purchase, then return to that store later to make a second purchase, you must start another Rakuten shopping trip in order to earn Cash Back.

If you use multiple windows on your browser, the window in which you shop at the store must have come from a Rakuten link.

You accept these terms when you enroll a card in the Service. Company may add to, change or remove any part of these terms from time to time. If Company changes any material terms that would have a material adverse effect on your rights as they are presented to you in these terms, Company will notify you via email or through other reasonable electronic means. Your continued participation in the Service, including receiving benefits and rewards when you make a qualifying transaction at participating merchants, constitutes your acceptance of any changes to these terms.

To receive benefits and rewards through the Service, you must enroll a valid, eligible card with the Service. Company leverages the transaction matching technology provided by the Rakuten Card Linked Offer Network, Inc. (""RCLON"" and together with Company, ""we"" or ""us"") to provide you the Services. Company also collaborates with third party offer networks, including but not limited to Rewards Network Establishment Services Inc. (“Offer Networks”) to provide you additional offers and features to the Services.

By enrolling a card in the Service, you agree that your payment card network (e.g., MasterCard, American Express, Visa) or payment processor may monitor transactions on your enrolled card at participating merchants and share Transaction Data (defined below) with us for the purposes of determining whether you have made a qualifying purchase and providing you targeted offers. Transaction Data includes, but is not limited to, merchant name, merchant location or other store identifier, transaction date, and transaction amount. We will also share details of your qualifying purchases with Offer Networks in order for you to participate in the additional rewards programs you choose. You agree that none of the payment card networks have any responsibility or liability in connection with the Service.

You may remove your payment cards from the Service at any time by visiting My Wallet. When you do so, we will no longer receive future Transaction Data associated with your payment card, but we will retain historical Transaction Data to track rewards and benefits due under the Service and for account management and member services purposes.

Card and Transaction Eligibility

The Service is limited to payment card transactions processed through the payment card networks and supported payment card processors. If a payment card transaction is processed outside one of the payment card networks or payment card processors with which we are integrated, we will not receive the Transaction Data and we will not be able to match it with an offer. Payment cards not eligible for use with the Service include, without limitation, corporate and purchasing cards, Health Savings Account (HSA) cards, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) cards, government-administered prepaid cards (including EBT cards), insurance prepaid cards and Visa Buxx.

Not all merchant locations or transactions with your enrolled card may be eligible for benefits and rewards, including PIN-based purchases, payments made through third-party digital wallets or payment apps other than Apple Pay® and other transactions not processed through the payment card network’s own system. Do not use a Personal Identification Number (PIN) when paying for your purchase transactions if you want the transaction to qualify for rewards or benefits under the Service.

The rewards for which you are eligible may vary depending on a variety of factors, such as the participating merchant and your level of activity within the Service. You may be eligible for rewards and offers that are not available to others and other rewards and benefits may not be available to you. Information on the type, amount, limits, and other conditions on rewards and benefits available to you, as well as current participating merchants, are available by signing in to your account with your unique login. You are responsible for reviewing this information before you make a purchase at a participating merchant, as these details may change from time to time and may affect the rewards and offers you receive.

In some cases, a participating merchant’s payment card processor may experience a lag time (approximately 24 hours) between when a credit card is enrolled and when the payment card processor is able to identify and provide us with the Transaction Data associated with the card. If you believe that you are eligible for rewards for dining at a participating merchant, and those rewards have not registered in your account within 10 days of the dine, please visit https://www.rakuten.com/help/missing-cash-back We reserve the right to require that you provide a receipt from the participating merchant or documents reasonably required by us to evidence an eligible transaction in order to receive your reward.

Limits on enrolled cards

You may register up to twelve (12) cards with our restaurant program, but any one eligible card may be enrolled in only one dining program. If you subsequently enroll a registered card with another dining program that is not operated by us, we will remove your card from participating in our dining program. For example, if you enrolled your credit card to earn rewards under our Restaurants In-Store Offers, and you later enroll that same credit card to earn rewards under a third-party dining program, you will no longer be eligible to earn rewards under our Restaurant In-Store Offers, and we will notify you of this by email.

Data Sharing and Usage

To operate the Service, we will share and use payment card and Transaction Data in order to:

*   Provide information about your enrolled card to payment card networks so they may monitor transactions on your card at participating merchants.
*   Receive Transaction Data from payment card networks or payment card processors for enrolled cards at participating merchants to determine qualifying transactions and provide you with benefits and rewards. Such data may also be used to target offers that may be of interest to you in the future.
*   Provide all or a portion of the information collected to Offer Networks, and our respective third-party suppliers, vendors, or contractors to facilitate and administer the Services.
*   Analyze Transaction Data to create performance reports that may be shared with publishers, merchants and their agents. These analyses may also be used to support general marketing to encourage consumers to enroll in the Service.
*   Provide Transaction Data to participating merchants or their agents to validate qualifying transactions and assess the results of specific campaigns.
*   Share Transaction Data with certain participating publishers so they can provide rewards and benefits to you and assess merchant campaign performance.

Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others

We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including, but not limited to, subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Company or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

4.1 You and Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement, Company’s business, any of the Programs or the Company Properties, and relationship with you, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate includes any claims against Company’s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of Company. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding in state or federal court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.

4.2 All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration.

With our Cash Back for Change program, you can donate the change from your quarterly Cash Back payment to our partner nonprofits. All you need to do is opt in to start giving back.

How does it work?

To participate, you’ll need to opt in. You can also do this in your [Account Settings](https://www.rakuten.com/account-settings.htm). Then, when it’s time to get your Cash Back payment, we’ll automatically donate the change portion to our partner nonprofits and give you the rest. You’ll still get your remaining Cash Back amount via the method you’ve selected (PayPal or physical check). For example, if your next Big Fat Check is $50.85, you’ll get $50 and give $0.85 to nonprofits.

Who can participate?

If you get your Cash Back payment via PayPal or check, you’re eligible to participate! Members who get paid via American Express Membership Rewards® Points aren’t eligible to opt in to the program. You can still help by donating directly to our partner nonprofits.

What nonprofits does it benefit?

We’ve partnered with 3 nonprofits who are committed to making the world a better place. Your Cash Back for Change donations will be split between each of these organizations.

Direct Relief is a humanitarian organization active in all 50 states and more than 100 countries. The Direct Relief mission is to improve the health and lives of people affected by poverty or emergencies—without regard to politics, religion or ability to pay. In response to the many natural disasters occurring throughout the US and across the globe, Rakuten partners with Direct Relief to help improve the health and lives of people affected by poverty or emergency situations by mobilizing and providing essential resources needed for their care and to help lift these communities up again.

Eat. Learn. Play. seeks to unlock the human potential of every child. Founded by three-time NBA champion Stephen Curry and entrepreneur, TV host and _New York Times_ bestselling author Ayesha Curry, the program addresses the Currys’ passion for 3 core pillars vital to a successful childhood: nutrition, education and physical activity. Rakuten and Eat. Learn. Play. team up to prioritize underprivileged children, ensuring they have the necessary food and access to quality education to enable a healthy, active lifestyle that allows them to flourish.

Girls Inc. of Alameda County is a nonprofit organization that focuses on preparing young women ages 6 to 18 to excel in the classroom and in their careers. With activities spanning more than 1,400 sites in 400 cities in the US and Canada, their mission is to focus on the development of each girl as an individual by supporting, mentoring and guiding them. These girls learn to value their whole selves, discover and develop their inherent strengths and receive the support they need to navigate the challenges they face. Rakuten is partnered with Girls Inc. of Alameda to support quality education that positively impacts girls by equipping them with skills to navigate through economic, gender and social barriers in their school years.

Are my Cash Back for Change donations tax deductible?

We will not provide a tax receipt for your Cash Back for Change donations. You can talk to your tax advisor about deductions for any donations you make.

How do I opt out?

In your [Account Settings](https://www.rakuten.com/account-settings.htm), find Cash Back for Change, and switch the toggle off to opt out. If you change your mind and want to opt in again, simply switch the toggle back on to participate. Be sure to opt in or out before the 1st of the next payment month so your request is processed before we send your Cash Back."

**3\. Disclosure of Information**

We may disclose the below-specified categories of information for our business or commercial purposes, including the following:

**Disclosure to Our Service Providers**

We may disclose all categories of your collected personal information as necessary with our third-party service providers (which may include Company affiliates) who perform various business operations, solely for our benefit or on our behalf, under our instructions and in compliance with appropriate contractual, technical and organizational security measures to protect your data from unauthorized use, retention, or disclosure. For example, we may partner with other companies to provide you member support services, authentication services, prevent fraud on our Services, process payments, administer our promotions, referral programs, sweepstakes, and surveys, perform analytics, maintain the accuracy of our databases, deliver direct marketing and communications, limit delivery of repetitive or unnecessary marketing or communications, facilitate your gift card purchases, fulfill your product purchases, place and fulfill your takeout orders, and administer your rewards or payments.

**Disclosure to Our Business Partners**

We work with various types of third-party business partners to offer you our Cash Back shopping Services. We may disclose the following types of information with the following types of Business Partners:

**Affiliate Partners**

When you click on a link to a merchant site presented on our Services to start your Cash Back shopping, you evidence your intent to interact with that business through our Services, and thereby are directing us to disclose certain information about you (including the link you clicked in our Services and a unique ID assigned to track that your shopping originated from our Services) to an affiliate network to properly account for your purchases with a merchant. For a small number of merchants that do not utilize an affiliate network, this information is provided directly to the merchant. The Affiliate Partner will collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of our Services in relation to the merchant site, products, or offers. Our Affiliate Partners collect this information to track the shopping trip, but some of them may also use this information to measure performance, contribute it to their own user profiles and/or combine it with information they collect elsewhere, which they may make available for use by their other business clients. In such cases, our disclosure to certain of these Affiliate Partners could be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information as those terms are defined under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and the opt-out we offer to consumers in Section 5, below, would signal these Affiliate Partners to not collect or use your information from our Services except as necessary to validate and provide your Cash Back.

In addition, to the limited extent that we target direct marketing to you or personalize the offers you see in our Services based on the profile data we compile from your behavior tracked via our Services, for the direct benefit of a particular merchant, this marketing or personalization may also be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for the purposes of “targeted advertising” of your personal information. In this circumstance, the opt-out we provide in Section 5, below, would cover this type of targeted marketing and personalization. We may use information we collect about you in combination with information about you from current and prospective merchant partners to test and analyze how our Services help merchants and business partners. The information we disclose to and receive from a merchant or business partner to effectuate this analysis may include online shopping identifiers (such as shopping ID’s, order ID’s), a hashed email address, and Commercial Information (such as whether a purchase was made and the corresponding order value). We may use the results from these tests in an aggregated and deidentified manner to improve our Services and to market our Services to merchants and business clients. You may opt out of our disclosure of your information to these certain third parties for this purpose in accordance with Section 5, below.

**Referral Marketing Partners**

In order to expand your options to sign up for our Services and start your Cash Back shopping from third-party sites where you learn about our Services, we contract with certain referral marketing business partners to enable that functionality, which may require that we disclose certain data about you to them. For example, if you are referred to our Services from a business partner’s websites, we may provide that partner with information about your sign up to validate the referral and activate your Services account access from the partner’s site. In addition, we may disclose information about whether you have made a purchase with us recently and whether you have installed our mobile app or browser extension so that the partner can personalize their email and site content to you. This information disclosure about your behavior in our Services may be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, so we provide an opt-out opportunity in Section 5, below.

If you signed up for cash back through our sister company, ShopStyle, Inc. (“ShopStyle”), we may provide ShopStyle with certain transaction information so that you can view your rewards summary on www.shopstyle.com. We may also place a cookie on your device so that you can continue your cash back shopping through www.shopstyle.com without having to sign in to our Services each time. For more information on how ShopStyle processes personal information, please visit [www.shopstyle.com/privacy.](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/www.shopstyle.com/privacy)

**Financial Partners**

For the purposes of providing you additional redemption options for your Cash Back and to market our co-branded credit cards to you, we may disclose your collected information, including Identifiers, to financial business partners, which may include Rakuten Group Companies. If you select loyalty points or other alternative methods of receiving your Cash Back, you are directing us to disclose your personal information, as necessary, to the relevant financial partner to facilitate that transaction. If you indicate that you would like to receive information about our co-branded credit cards from our financial partner(s), you are also directing us to disclose your information to such parties to enable them to provide that information.

We may also disclose personal information about you to our financial partners in order to facilitate their marketing purposes and in some instances for the financial partner to directly send marketing to you. This could be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and you may opt-out of this disclosure for partner marketing in Section 5, below.

**Disclosure to Digital Advertising Providers**

To provide us with targeted advertising and marketing services, we partner with certain third parties that automatically collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of the Services, such as your browsing history, IP address, pages viewed, and links clicked, so that they can use this information to serve you ads for our Services on other sites you visit. Some of these third parties may also use this collected information to draw inferences about you for their own purposes or separately collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites (in addition to our Services) to help predict your preferences and to display (and enable other third parties to display) ads to you that are more likely to be of interest to you. You have the right to opt out of our sharing of your information with certain third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral or targeted advertising. To exercise this right, you can opt-out via the instructions in Section 5, below. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of data and does not include further use of data by third parties. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising in general, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

**Disclosure to Other Rakuten Group Companies**

We work closely with our affiliated businesses and companies within the Rakuten Group and disclose your personal information for our internal business administration. Some of our Service Providers and Business Partners to whom we disclose personal information, as described above, may include other Rakuten Group Companies. We may also disclose information in the categories of Identifiers (email address), Commercial Information (product metrics), and Internet and other Network Activity to our affiliates within the Rakuten Group for those corporate affiliates to analyze and monitor usage and trends to improve their services and websites and for strategic planning purposes at the Rakuten Group level. Our opt-out and delete request functionality will serve to remove you from these disclosures.

**Disclosure for Legal Purposes**

We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) in response to subpoenas or other legal processes or if, in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required or permitted by law without a specific disclosure; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to enforce our terms and conditions or other policies applicable to our Services; and (iv) to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of Company or any third party.

**In Relation to Business Asset Transfers**

We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to any third party in connection with, or during confidential negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession) or any other type of acquisition of all or any portion of Company assets, conveyance or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company. In such event, the acquiring company would be contractually required to use your collected information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law or to provide prior notice to you of any new or materially changed practices.

In addition to the above listed disclosures, we may also disclose aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used by recipients to identify you.

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/card-linked-offers-terms-conditions-360002117827,"Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. dba Rakuten Rewards is the owner and operator of www.ebates.com and www.rakuten.com (""Company"") and offers a service enabling you to enroll a payment card in order to earn rewards or benefits when you make qualifying transactions at participating merchants (""Service"").

You accept these terms when you enroll a card in the Service. Company may add to, change or remove any part of these terms from time to time. If Company changes any material terms that would have a material adverse effect on your rights as they are presented to you in these terms, Company will notify you via email or through other reasonable electronic means. Your continued participation in the Service, including receiving benefits and rewards when you make a qualifying transaction at participating merchants, constitutes your acceptance of any changes to these terms.

To receive benefits and rewards through the Service, you must enroll a valid, eligible card with the Service. Company leverages the transaction matching technology provided by the Rakuten Card Linked Offer Network, Inc. (""RCLON"" and together with Company, ""we"" or ""us"") to provide you the Services. Company also collaborates with third party offer networks, including but not limited to Rewards Network Establishment Services Inc. (“Offer Networks”) to provide you additional offers and features to the Services.

By enrolling a card in the Service, you agree that your payment card network (e.g., MasterCard, American Express, Visa) or payment processor may monitor transactions on your enrolled card at participating merchants and share Transaction Data (defined below) with us for the purposes of determining whether you have made a qualifying purchase and providing you targeted offers. Transaction Data includes, but is not limited to, merchant name, merchant location or other store identifier, transaction date, and transaction amount. We will also share details of your qualifying purchases with Offer Networks in order for you to participate in the additional rewards programs you choose. You agree that none of the payment card networks have any responsibility or liability in connection with the Service.

You may remove your payment cards from the Service at any time by visiting My Wallet. When you do so, we will no longer receive future Transaction Data associated with your payment card, but we will retain historical Transaction Data to track rewards and benefits due under the Service and for account management and member services purposes.

Card and Transaction Eligibility

The Service is limited to payment card transactions processed through the payment card networks and supported payment card processors. If a payment card transaction is processed outside one of the payment card networks or payment card processors with which we are integrated, we will not receive the Transaction Data and we will not be able to match it with an offer. Payment cards not eligible for use with the Service include, without limitation, corporate and purchasing cards, Health Savings Account (HSA) cards, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) cards, government-administered prepaid cards (including EBT cards), insurance prepaid cards and Visa Buxx.

Not all merchant locations or transactions with your enrolled card may be eligible for benefits and rewards, including PIN-based purchases, payments made through third-party digital wallets or payment apps other than Apple Pay® and other transactions not processed through the payment card network’s own system. Do not use a Personal Identification Number (PIN) when paying for your purchase transactions if you want the transaction to qualify for rewards or benefits under the Service.

The rewards for which you are eligible may vary depending on a variety of factors, such as the participating merchant and your level of activity within the Service. You may be eligible for rewards and offers that are not available to others and other rewards and benefits may not be available to you. Information on the type, amount, limits, and other conditions on rewards and benefits available to you, as well as current participating merchants, are available by signing in to your account with your unique login. You are responsible for reviewing this information before you make a purchase at a participating merchant, as these details may change from time to time and may affect the rewards and offers you receive.

In some cases, a participating merchant’s payment card processor may experience a lag time (approximately 24 hours) between when a credit card is enrolled and when the payment card processor is able to identify and provide us with the Transaction Data associated with the card. If you believe that you are eligible for rewards for dining at a participating merchant, and those rewards have not registered in your account within 10 days of the dine, please visit https://www.rakuten.com/help/missing-cash-back We reserve the right to require that you provide a receipt from the participating merchant or documents reasonably required by us to evidence an eligible transaction in order to receive your reward.

Limits on enrolled cards

You may register up to twelve (12) cards with our restaurant program, but any one eligible card may be enrolled in only one dining program. If you subsequently enroll a registered card with another dining program that is not operated by us, we will remove your card from participating in our dining program. For example, if you enrolled your credit card to earn rewards under our Restaurants In-Store Offers, and you later enroll that same credit card to earn rewards under a third-party dining program, you will no longer be eligible to earn rewards under our Restaurant In-Store Offers, and we will notify you of this by email.

Data Sharing and Usage

To operate the Service, we will share and use payment card and Transaction Data in order to:

*   Provide information about your enrolled card to payment card networks so they may monitor transactions on your card at participating merchants.
*   Receive Transaction Data from payment card networks or payment card processors for enrolled cards at participating merchants to determine qualifying transactions and provide you with benefits and rewards. Such data may also be used to target offers that may be of interest to you in the future.
*   Provide all or a portion of the information collected to Offer Networks, and our respective third-party suppliers, vendors, or contractors to facilitate and administer the Services.
*   Analyze Transaction Data to create performance reports that may be shared with publishers, merchants and their agents. These analyses may also be used to support general marketing to encourage consumers to enroll in the Service.
*   Provide Transaction Data to participating merchants or their agents to validate qualifying transactions and assess the results of specific campaigns.
*   Share Transaction Data with certain participating publishers so they can provide rewards and benefits to you and assess merchant campaign performance.

Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including, but not limited to, subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Company or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

**1\. Cash Back Shopping.** The browser extension is made available to enhance your shopping experience with www.rakuten.com by providing you with relevant offers and references displayed on your browser. When you visit certain sites, the browser extension may display Cash Back shopping opportunities and prompt you to start your Cash Back shopping session via www.rakuten.com. The browser extension may also alert you of a deal or offer available through www.rakuten.com with respect to a product or brand appearing in your search results or on other pages you visit across the web, and prompt you to start a shopping session at one of our merchants. If you start a shopping session using the browser extension, it will set a cookie (or other similar tracking technologies) on your device through our affiliate network for the purpose of tracking your shopping session and crediting your Cash Back reward — just as if you had begun your shopping experience via any of our links to merchant sites on www.rakuten.com.

Information collected by the browser extension for these purposes may include date and time of use, browser type, browser version, URLs of web pages visited, general information about the visited web page, product searches, product search results, information about products added to cart, and other product information. The browser extension may also collect and use data, such as the order contents and order total, from order confirmation pages so we may confirm your Cash Back faster and more reliably. We do not intentionally collect nor use other types of information that may be included on a merchant’s order confirmation page, such as your address or partial payment information, although this information may be incidentally captured to the limited extent it is displayed by the merchant.

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

as of the date such litigation is filed.

4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

stating that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its

distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and

wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

the conditions stated in this License.

5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

1.1 or earlier of the License, but not also under the terms of a

Secondary License.

1.6. “Executable Form”

otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the

outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2\. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,

non-exclusive license:

a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

part of a Larger Work; and

b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for

sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions

or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become

effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes

such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this

License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution

or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section

2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s

modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its

Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor

Version); or

c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its

Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or

logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the

notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License

(see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted

under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions

are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the

rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable

copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in

Section 2.1.

3\. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any

Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the

terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form

of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how

they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or

restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,

as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the

Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by

reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost

of distribution to the recipient; and

b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,

or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for

the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’

rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,

provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the

Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software

with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered

Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits

You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of

such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at

their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of

either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including

copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations

of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered

Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent

required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,

indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered

Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf

of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such

warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You

alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any

liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,

indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional

disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any

jurisdiction.

4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License

with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial

order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License

to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code

they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all

distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the

extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be

sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to

understand it.

5\. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You

fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,

then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor

are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor

explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,

if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some

reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an

ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by

some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of

non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become

compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent

infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,

and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or

indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and

all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License

shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user

license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been

validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to

termination shall survive termination.

6\. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without

warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,

without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,

merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire

risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.

Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any

Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or

correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this

License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License

except under this disclaimer.

7\. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including

negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who

distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any

character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of

goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been

informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability

shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such

party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or

consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8\. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of

a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business

and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without

reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall

prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9\. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter

hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such

provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it

enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a

contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe

this License against a Contributor.

10\. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section

10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a

distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of

the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or

under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license

steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to

create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified

version of this License if you rename the license and remove any

references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such

modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the

notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

This Source Code Form is subject to the

terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.

2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not

distributed with this file, You can

obtain one at

http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then

You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant

directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

This Source Code Form is “Incompatible

With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by

the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

the conditions stated in this License.

5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or

Object form.

3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,

each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,

no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent

license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise

transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims

licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work

to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation

against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)

alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work

constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date

such litigation is filed.

4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in

Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of

this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You

changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,

all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form

of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the

Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any

Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the

attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices

that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the

following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the

Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along

with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative

Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of

the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the

License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that

You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,

provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as

modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your

modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and

conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for

any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and

distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this

License.

5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any

Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have

executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,

trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required

for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and

reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in

writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its

Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY

KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties

or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in

writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,

computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or

losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such

damages.

9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or

Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,

acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations

and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such

obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole

responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to

indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred

by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any

such warranty or additional liability.

2\. License Grants and Conditions

\--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,

non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer

for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its

Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution

become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first

distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under

this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the

distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.

Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a

Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;

or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's

modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its

Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor

Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of

its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,

or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with

the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this

License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if

permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its

Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights

to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under

applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other

equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted

in Section 2.1.

3\. Responsibilities

\-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any

Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under

the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source

Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this

License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not

attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code

Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code

Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of

the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code

Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more

than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this

License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the

license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter

the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,

provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for

the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered

Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the

Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this

License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software

under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of

the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered

Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary

License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices

(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,

or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of

the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to

the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,

indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered

Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on

behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any

such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by

You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any

liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,

indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional

disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any

jurisdiction.

4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

\---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this

License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to

statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with

the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)

describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must

be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered

Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute

or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a

recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5\. Termination

\--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically

if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become

compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular

Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such

Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an

ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the

non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have

come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular

Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor

notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the

first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License

from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after

Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent

infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,

counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version

directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to

You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section

2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all

end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which

have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License

prior to termination shall survive termination.

\*                                                                      \*

\*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an ""as is""       \*

\*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  \*

\*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       \*

\*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        \*

\*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     \*

\*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        \*

\*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     \*

\*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   \*

\*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   \*

\*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   \*

\*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         \*

\*                                                                      \*

\*  7. Limitation of Liability                                          \*

\*  --------------------------                                          \*

\*                                                                      \*

\*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      \*

\*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           \*

\*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          \*

\*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         \*

\*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      \*

\*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    \*

\*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    \*

\*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      \*

\*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   \*

\*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   \*

\*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       \*

\*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               \*

\*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           \*

\*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          \*

\*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    \*

\*                                                                      \*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

8\. Litigation

\-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the

courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal

place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that

jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring

cross-claims or counter-claims.

9\. Miscellaneous

\----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject

matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be

unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent

necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides

that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter

shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10\. Versions of the License

\---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section

10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a

distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version

of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,

or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license

steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to

create a new license for such software, you may create and use a

modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove

any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that

such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary

Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the

notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

If you choose to participate in our referral programs, you represent and warrant that you have a personal relationship with your referral and that you are authorized to share their information with Company for the purpose of Company sending a communication to invite them to join the Services. If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information through our referral service and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact our member services at [https://www.rakuten.com/help/other-questions](https://www.rakuten.com/help/other-questions).

**3\. Disclosure of Information**

We may disclose the below-specified categories of information for our business or commercial purposes, including the following:

**Disclosure to Our Service Providers**

We may disclose all categories of your collected personal information as necessary with our third-party service providers (which may include Company affiliates) who perform various business operations, solely for our benefit or on our behalf, under our instructions and in compliance with appropriate contractual, technical and organizational security measures to protect your data from unauthorized use, retention, or disclosure. For example, we may partner with other companies to provide you member support services, authentication services, prevent fraud on our Services, process payments, administer our promotions, referral programs, sweepstakes, and surveys, perform analytics, maintain the accuracy of our databases, deliver direct marketing and communications, limit delivery of repetitive or unnecessary marketing or communications, facilitate your gift card purchases, fulfill your product purchases, place and fulfill your takeout orders, and administer your rewards or payments.

**Disclosure to Our Business Partners**

We work with various types of third-party business partners to offer you our Cash Back shopping Services. We may disclose the following types of information with the following types of Business Partners:

**Affiliate Partners**

When you click on a link to a merchant site presented on our Services to start your Cash Back shopping, you evidence your intent to interact with that business through our Services, and thereby are directing us to disclose certain information about you (including the link you clicked in our Services and a unique ID assigned to track that your shopping originated from our Services) to an affiliate network to properly account for your purchases with a merchant. For a small number of merchants that do not utilize an affiliate network, this information is provided directly to the merchant. The Affiliate Partner will collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of our Services in relation to the merchant site, products, or offers. Our Affiliate Partners collect this information to track the shopping trip, but some of them may also use this information to measure performance, contribute it to their own user profiles and/or combine it with information they collect elsewhere, which they may make available for use by their other business clients. In such cases, our disclosure to certain of these Affiliate Partners could be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information as those terms are defined under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and the opt-out we offer to consumers in Section 5, below, would signal these Affiliate Partners to not collect or use your information from our Services except as necessary to validate and provide your Cash Back.

In addition, to the limited extent that we target direct marketing to you or personalize the offers you see in our Services based on the profile data we compile from your behavior tracked via our Services, for the direct benefit of a particular merchant, this marketing or personalization may also be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for the purposes of “targeted advertising” of your personal information. In this circumstance, the opt-out we provide in Section 5, below, would cover this type of targeted marketing and personalization. We may use information we collect about you in combination with information about you from current and prospective merchant partners to test and analyze how our Services help merchants and business partners. The information we disclose to and receive from a merchant or business partner to effectuate this analysis may include online shopping identifiers (such as shopping ID’s, order ID’s), a hashed email address, and Commercial Information (such as whether a purchase was made and the corresponding order value). We may use the results from these tests in an aggregated and deidentified manner to improve our Services and to market our Services to merchants and business clients. You may opt out of our disclosure of your information to these certain third parties for this purpose in accordance with Section 5, below.

**Referral Marketing Partners**

In order to expand your options to sign up for our Services and start your Cash Back shopping from third-party sites where you learn about our Services, we contract with certain referral marketing business partners to enable that functionality, which may require that we disclose certain data about you to them. For example, if you are referred to our Services from a business partner’s websites, we may provide that partner with information about your sign up to validate the referral and activate your Services account access from the partner’s site. In addition, we may disclose information about whether you have made a purchase with us recently and whether you have installed our mobile app or browser extension so that the partner can personalize their email and site content to you. This information disclosure about your behavior in our Services may be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, so we provide an opt-out opportunity in Section 5, below.

If you signed up for cash back through our sister company, ShopStyle, Inc. (“ShopStyle”), we may provide ShopStyle with certain transaction information so that you can view your rewards summary on www.shopstyle.com. We may also place a cookie on your device so that you can continue your cash back shopping through www.shopstyle.com without having to sign in to our Services each time. For more information on how ShopStyle processes personal information, please visit [www.shopstyle.com/privacy.](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/www.shopstyle.com/privacy)

**Financial Partners**

For the purposes of providing you additional redemption options for your Cash Back and to market our co-branded credit cards to you, we may disclose your collected information, including Identifiers, to financial business partners, which may include Rakuten Group Companies. If you select loyalty points or other alternative methods of receiving your Cash Back, you are directing us to disclose your personal information, as necessary, to the relevant financial partner to facilitate that transaction. If you indicate that you would like to receive information about our co-branded credit cards from our financial partner(s), you are also directing us to disclose your information to such parties to enable them to provide that information.

We may also disclose personal information about you to our financial partners in order to facilitate their marketing purposes and in some instances for the financial partner to directly send marketing to you. This could be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and you may opt-out of this disclosure for partner marketing in Section 5, below.

**Disclosure to Digital Advertising Providers**

To provide us with targeted advertising and marketing services, we partner with certain third parties that automatically collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of the Services, such as your browsing history, IP address, pages viewed, and links clicked, so that they can use this information to serve you ads for our Services on other sites you visit. Some of these third parties may also use this collected information to draw inferences about you for their own purposes or separately collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites (in addition to our Services) to help predict your preferences and to display (and enable other third parties to display) ads to you that are more likely to be of interest to you. You have the right to opt out of our sharing of your information with certain third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral or targeted advertising. To exercise this right, you can opt-out via the instructions in Section 5, below. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of data and does not include further use of data by third parties. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising in general, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

**Disclosure to Other Rakuten Group Companies**

We work closely with our affiliated businesses and companies within the Rakuten Group and disclose your personal information for our internal business administration. Some of our Service Providers and Business Partners to whom we disclose personal information, as described above, may include other Rakuten Group Companies. We may also disclose information in the categories of Identifiers (email address), Commercial Information (product metrics), and Internet and other Network Activity to our affiliates within the Rakuten Group for those corporate affiliates to analyze and monitor usage and trends to improve their services and websites and for strategic planning purposes at the Rakuten Group level. Our opt-out and delete request functionality will serve to remove you from these disclosures.

**Disclosure for Legal Purposes**

We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) in response to subpoenas or other legal processes or if, in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required or permitted by law without a specific disclosure; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to enforce our terms and conditions or other policies applicable to our Services; and (iv) to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of Company or any third party.

**In Relation to Business Asset Transfers**

We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to any third party in connection with, or during confidential negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession) or any other type of acquisition of all or any portion of Company assets, conveyance or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company. In such event, the acquiring company would be contractually required to use your collected information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law or to provide prior notice to you of any new or materially changed practices.

In addition to the above listed disclosures, we may also disclose aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used by recipients to identify you.

**3\. Disclosure of Information**

We may disclose the below-specified categories of information for our business or commercial purposes, including the following:

**Disclosure to Our Service Providers**

We may disclose all categories of your collected personal information as necessary with our third-party service providers (which may include Company affiliates) who perform various business operations, solely for our benefit or on our behalf, under our instructions and in compliance with appropriate contractual, technical and organizational security measures to protect your data from unauthorized use, retention, or disclosure. For example, we may partner with other companies to provide you member support services, authentication services, prevent fraud on our Services, process payments, administer our promotions, referral programs, sweepstakes, and surveys, perform analytics, maintain the accuracy of our databases, deliver direct marketing and communications, limit delivery of repetitive or unnecessary marketing or communications, facilitate your gift card purchases, fulfill your product purchases, place and fulfill your takeout orders, and administer your rewards or payments.

**Disclosure to Our Business Partners**

We work with various types of third-party business partners to offer you our Cash Back shopping Services. We may disclose the following types of information with the following types of Business Partners:

**Affiliate Partners**

When you click on a link to a merchant site presented on our Services to start your Cash Back shopping, you evidence your intent to interact with that business through our Services, and thereby are directing us to disclose certain information about you (including the link you clicked in our Services and a unique ID assigned to track that your shopping originated from our Services) to an affiliate network to properly account for your purchases with a merchant. For a small number of merchants that do not utilize an affiliate network, this information is provided directly to the merchant. The Affiliate Partner will collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of our Services in relation to the merchant site, products, or offers. Our Affiliate Partners collect this information to track the shopping trip, but some of them may also use this information to measure performance, contribute it to their own user profiles and/or combine it with information they collect elsewhere, which they may make available for use by their other business clients. In such cases, our disclosure to certain of these Affiliate Partners could be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information as those terms are defined under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and the opt-out we offer to consumers in Section 5, below, would signal these Affiliate Partners to not collect or use your information from our Services except as necessary to validate and provide your Cash Back.

In addition, to the limited extent that we target direct marketing to you or personalize the offers you see in our Services based on the profile data we compile from your behavior tracked via our Services, for the direct benefit of a particular merchant, this marketing or personalization may also be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for the purposes of “targeted advertising” of your personal information. In this circumstance, the opt-out we provide in Section 5, below, would cover this type of targeted marketing and personalization. We may use information we collect about you in combination with information about you from current and prospective merchant partners to test and analyze how our Services help merchants and business partners. The information we disclose to and receive from a merchant or business partner to effectuate this analysis may include online shopping identifiers (such as shopping ID’s, order ID’s), a hashed email address, and Commercial Information (such as whether a purchase was made and the corresponding order value). We may use the results from these tests in an aggregated and deidentified manner to improve our Services and to market our Services to merchants and business clients. You may opt out of our disclosure of your information to these certain third parties for this purpose in accordance with Section 5, below.

**Referral Marketing Partners**

In order to expand your options to sign up for our Services and start your Cash Back shopping from third-party sites where you learn about our Services, we contract with certain referral marketing business partners to enable that functionality, which may require that we disclose certain data about you to them. For example, if you are referred to our Services from a business partner’s websites, we may provide that partner with information about your sign up to validate the referral and activate your Services account access from the partner’s site. In addition, we may disclose information about whether you have made a purchase with us recently and whether you have installed our mobile app or browser extension so that the partner can personalize their email and site content to you. This information disclosure about your behavior in our Services may be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, so we provide an opt-out opportunity in Section 5, below.

If you signed up for cash back through our sister company, ShopStyle, Inc. (“ShopStyle”), we may provide ShopStyle with certain transaction information so that you can view your rewards summary on www.shopstyle.com. We may also place a cookie on your device so that you can continue your cash back shopping through www.shopstyle.com without having to sign in to our Services each time. For more information on how ShopStyle processes personal information, please visit [www.shopstyle.com/privacy.](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/www.shopstyle.com/privacy)

**Financial Partners**

For the purposes of providing you additional redemption options for your Cash Back and to market our co-branded credit cards to you, we may disclose your collected information, including Identifiers, to financial business partners, which may include Rakuten Group Companies. If you select loyalty points or other alternative methods of receiving your Cash Back, you are directing us to disclose your personal information, as necessary, to the relevant financial partner to facilitate that transaction. If you indicate that you would like to receive information about our co-branded credit cards from our financial partner(s), you are also directing us to disclose your information to such parties to enable them to provide that information.

We may also disclose personal information about you to our financial partners in order to facilitate their marketing purposes and in some instances for the financial partner to directly send marketing to you. This could be considered “selling”, “sharing”, or processing for “targeted advertising” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws, and you may opt-out of this disclosure for partner marketing in Section 5, below.

**Disclosure to Digital Advertising Providers**

To provide us with targeted advertising and marketing services, we partner with certain third parties that automatically collect Internet and Network Activity information about your use of the Services, such as your browsing history, IP address, pages viewed, and links clicked, so that they can use this information to serve you ads for our Services on other sites you visit. Some of these third parties may also use this collected information to draw inferences about you for their own purposes or separately collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites (in addition to our Services) to help predict your preferences and to display (and enable other third parties to display) ads to you that are more likely to be of interest to you. You have the right to opt out of our sharing of your information with certain third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral or targeted advertising. To exercise this right, you can opt-out via the instructions in Section 5, below. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of data and does not include further use of data by third parties. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising in general, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

**Disclosure to Other Rakuten Group Companies**

We work closely with our affiliated businesses and companies within the Rakuten Group and disclose your personal information for our internal business administration. Some of our Service Providers and Business Partners to whom we disclose personal information, as described above, may include other Rakuten Group Companies. We may also disclose information in the categories of Identifiers (email address), Commercial Information (product metrics), and Internet and other Network Activity to our affiliates within the Rakuten Group for those corporate affiliates to analyze and monitor usage and trends to improve their services and websites and for strategic planning purposes at the Rakuten Group level. Our opt-out and delete request functionality will serve to remove you from these disclosures.

**Disclosure for Legal Purposes**

We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) in response to subpoenas or other legal processes or if, in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required or permitted by law without a specific disclosure; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to enforce our terms and conditions or other policies applicable to our Services; and (iv) to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of Company or any third party.

**In Relation to Business Asset Transfers**

We may disclose the information we collect, including personal information, to any third party in connection with, or during confidential negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession) or any other type of acquisition of all or any portion of Company assets, conveyance or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company. In such event, the acquiring company would be contractually required to use your collected information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law or to provide prior notice to you of any new or materially changed practices.

In addition to the above listed disclosures, we may also disclose aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used by recipients to identify you.

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/google-api-user-data-policy-disclosure-360053111934,"## Google API Disclosure

Rakuten uses Google APIs when you use Google to sign in to your Rakuten account. Our use of information from the Google APIs will be in compliance with the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements."
https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/advertising-disclosure-360002117787,"**How Do We Make Money?**

Our business is based on a simple idea: When you follow our links to visit a store, that store pays us a commission on whatever you buy during your visit. We then share that commission with you, our members, as Cash Back.

In other words, retailers pay to partner with us because we send shoppers to their websites or brick-and-mortar stores. They may also pay us to help grow their brand. That means we might feature them on our website, in emails, etc. Because of these partnerships, members like you benefit by earning Cash Back and getting great offers.

To sum it up, we help retailers succeed and, at the same time, help our members save money.

**What does it mean when Rakuten states that a cash back percentage ""was"" a certain amount?**

Stores pay us a commission for sending our members to their websites, and we share it with you as cash back. When a store joins Rakuten, we set a cash back percentage for that store (a ""base cash back percentage""). We work with our merchant partners to offer increased cash back from time to time to our members. An increased cash back percentage is often promoted alongside a ""was %"". The ""was %"" describes the ""base cash back percentage,"" but does not necessarily or always reflect the most recent cash back percentage or the most common cash back percentage for a store. The cash back percentage for any store is not a fixed percentage and is subject to change.

**YOU AGREE TO THE MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISIONS, DESCRIBED FULLY IN SECTION 4 BELOW, TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES WITH THE COMPANY, EXCEPT FOR THOSE MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL-CLAIMS COURT IN THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 23.2.**

**4\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

4.1 You and Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement, Company’s business, any of the Programs or the Company Properties, and relationship with you, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate includes any claims against Company’s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of Company. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding in state or federal court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.

4.2 All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration. You further agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.

4.3 **CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND COMPANY ALSO AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION**. This means that neither you nor Company can seek to assert class or representative claims against each other either in court or in arbitration and no relief can be awarded on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator also may not consolidate or join another person’s claim with your claim or issue an order that would achieve the same result. You and the Company further agree that if the provisions of this paragraph, known as the “Class Action Waiver,” are found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entire provision compelling arbitration shall be null and void.

4.4 To the extent possible under your local law, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules or pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”). The Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. If your claim in arbitration is for less than $10,000, Company will reimburse you for filing and arbitrator fees at the conclusion of the proceeding unless your claim is found to be frivolous by the arbitrator. The exclusive venue for any dispute or issue arising out of this Agreement shall be held in San Francisco County, California.

4.5 Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if we make any future, material change to this arbitration provision, you may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. DBA Rakuten Rewards, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, Attn: Rakuten Rewards Legal. Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which you have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.

4.6 This arbitration provision is optional. You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. dba Rakuten Rewards, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, Attn: Legal within thirty (30) calendar days of enrolling as a Member or accessing a Company Property for the first time.

4.7 Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.

**5\. PROGRAM LICENSE**

5.1 Subject to this Agreement, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sublicense) to access and use the Company Properties for your personal use to access the Program(s). You agree that you obtain no rights other than the rights and licenses expressly granted in this Agreement.

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/general-data-protection-regulation-360002117687,"Due to the new standards set forth by the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en) (GDPR), we’re currently unable to offer our services to residents of the European Economic Area (EEA).

**What is the GDPR, and how does it affect Rakuten?**

Created under EU law, the GDPR is a new regulation that affects how personal data is used and stored. Because Rakuten depends on our members’ data to link shopping activity to earning Cash Back, we must do additional work to ensure our services are in compliance with the new standards. As a result, residents of the EEA are currently experiencing a disruption in their ability to use Rakuten.

While we regret not being able to serve some of our valued members, we’re committed to protecting your personal data and letting you know exactly how it’s being used. Please know that we’re actively working to restore service to affected Rakuten members in a way that complies with the GDPR.

**Can EEA residents still use Rakuten to earn Cash Back?**

Unfortunately, not at this time. EEA residents can still access [My Account](https://www.rakuten.com/my-account.htm), including their payment history, reservations and other account settings. In addition, all Rakuten members have access to our Help Center and Member Services team.

**I’m an EEA resident. What happens to my Cash Back now?**

Rest assured that any Cash Back you’ve already earned will still be paid to you on [our regular schedule](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/getting-your-ebates-cash-back-payments-360002117667). You’re not able to earn additional Cash Back at this time, but you can still access [My Account](https://www.rakuten.com/my-account.htm), including your payment history, reservations and other account settings. Please know that we’re actively working to restore service to affected Rakuten members and appreciate your patience.

or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

the conditions stated in this License.

5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

1.1 or earlier of the License, but not also under the terms of a

Secondary License.

1.6. “Executable Form”

means any form of the work other than Source Code Form.

1.7. “Larger Work”

the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or

otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the

outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2\. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,

non-exclusive license:

a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

part of a Larger Work; and

b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for

sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions

or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become

effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes

such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this

License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution

or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section

2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s

modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its

Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor

Version); or

c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its

Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or

logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the

notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License

(see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted

under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions

are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the

rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable

copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in

Section 2.1.

3\. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any

Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the

terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form

of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how

they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or

restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,

as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the

Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by

reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost

of distribution to the recipient; and

b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,

or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for

the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’

rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,

provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the

Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software

with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered

Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits

You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of

such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at

their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of

either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including

copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations

of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered

Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent

required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,

indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered

Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf

of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such

warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You

alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any

liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,

indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional

disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any

jurisdiction.

4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License

with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial

order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License

to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code

they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all

distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the

extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be

sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to

understand it.

5\. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You

fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,

then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor

are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor

explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,

if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some

reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an

ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by

some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of

non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become

compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent

infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,

and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or

indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and

all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License

shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user

license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been

validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to

termination shall survive termination.

6\. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without

warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,

without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,

merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire

risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.

Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any

Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or

correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this

License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License

except under this disclaimer.

7\. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including

negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who

distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any

character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of

goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been

informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability

shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such

party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or

consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8\. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of

a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business

and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without

reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall

prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9\. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter

hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such

provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it

enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a

contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe

this License against a Contributor.

10\. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section

10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a

distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of

the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or

under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license

steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to

create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified

version of this License if you rename the license and remove any

references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such

modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the

notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

This Source Code Form is subject to the

terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.

2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not

distributed with this file, You can

obtain one at

http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then

You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant

directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

This Source Code Form is “Incompatible

With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by

the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

as of the date such litigation is filed.

4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and

wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

the conditions stated in this License.

5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,

WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,

no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent

transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims

licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work

to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation

against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)

alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work

constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date

Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of

the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the

License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that

You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,

provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as

modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your

modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and

conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for

any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and

distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this

License.

5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any

Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have

executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,

trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required

for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and

reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,

computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or

losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such

damages.

9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or

Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,

acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations

and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such

obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole

responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to

indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred

by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any

such warranty or additional liability.

\--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,

non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer

for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its

Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution

become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first

distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under

this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the

distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.

Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a

Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;

or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's

modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its

Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor

Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of

its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,

or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with

the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this

License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if

permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its

Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights

to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under

applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other

equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted

in Section 2.1.

3\. Responsibilities

\-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any

Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under

the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source

Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this

License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not

attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code

Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code

Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of

the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code

Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more

than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this

License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the

license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter

the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,

provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for

the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered

Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the

Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this

License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software

under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of

the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered

Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary

License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices

(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,

or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of

the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to

the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,

indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered

Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on

behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any

such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by

You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any

liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,

indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional

disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any

jurisdiction.

4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

\---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this

License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to

statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with

the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)

describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must

be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered

Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute

or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a

recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5\. Termination

\--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically

if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become

compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular

Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such

Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an

ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the

non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have

come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular

Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor

notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the

first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License

from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after

Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent

infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,

counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version

directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to

You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section

2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all

end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which

have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License

prior to termination shall survive termination.

\*                                                                      \*

\*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an ""as is""       \*

\*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  \*

\*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       \*

\*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        \*

\*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     \*

\*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        \*

\*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     \*

\*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   \*

\*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   \*

\*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   \*

\*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         \*

\*  --------------------------                                          \*

\*                                                                      \*

\*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      \*

\*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           \*

\*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          \*

\*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         \*

\*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      \*

\*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    \*

\*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    \*

\*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      \*

\*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   \*

\*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   \*

\*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       \*

\*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               \*

\*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           \*

\*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          \*

\*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    \*

\*                                                                      \*

8\. Litigation

\-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the

courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal

place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that

jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring

cross-claims or counter-claims.

9\. Miscellaneous

\----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject

matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be

unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent

necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides

that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter

shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10\. Versions of the License

\---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section

10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a

distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version

of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,

or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license

steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to

create a new license for such software, you may create and use a

modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove

any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that

such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary

Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the

notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/privacy-security-360002101648,"**What is our privacy policy?**

Our company was founded by two former Deputy District Attorneys who take privacy and security very seriously. We know that protecting member privacy is essential to our success. Please take the time to review our complete [Privacy Agreement](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/privacy-policy-360002101688).

**How secure is my credit card information?**

We comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard with respect to the environments we use to process, store and transmit payment card information to ensure your credit card information is processed securely.

**Are my transactions with you secure?**

Yes. We endeavor to work only with stores providing high levels of security and using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Internet connections to protect the integrity of your transaction.

**Will you sell information about me or my purchase habits?**

No. For more detailed information, please review our [privacy policy](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/privacy-policy-360002101688).

**What are ""cookies"" and how do I enable them?**

Cookies are simply text files that allow a site to recognize you when you return. This means you don’t have to log in again and again. Cookies used by Rakuten and our network of stores are completely safe, and they are enabled by default with most browsers.

**Will I start receiving ""spam"" if I join?**

No. We send two types of emails to our members: member-services emails required to maintain the program (such as Cash Back credits and payment notifications) and promotional emails featuring especially good offers. You may choose not to receive promotional emails at any time from your account page or by clicking the ""unsubscribe"" link in an email. We will not sell your information to any third party."
https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/how-instore-cash-back-works-360002117467,"You can earn Cash Back shopping in person at select stores, just like you do online.

Here’s how to get started with earning In-Store Cash Back:

1.  **Link a credit card to your Account.**
    
    [Link a card in your Account](https://www.rakuten.com/my-wallet.htm). You can earn in-store Cash Back with Visa, Mastercard and American Express.
    
2.  **Add the offer to your card.**
    
    Offers can only be used on a single purchase and are usually active for 45 days. Make sure to check offer details to see when the offer expires. The offer must be added to your linked credit card before making a purchase.
    
3.  **Go to the store and shop!**
    
    In-store Cash Back is only available for physical purchases made at the store. If you place an online purchase and pick up in-store, you will not earn in-store Cash Back.
    
4.  **Pay with your linked card to earn Cash Back.**
    
    Use your linked card when you’re purchasing in store.
    

**Debit cards MUST be run as credit to earn Cash Back in store.**

**Tips for maximizing your In-Store Cash Back:**

*   Re-add offers after you shop. Added offers are valid for one purchase only.
*   Use the App to add an offer while you’re in the store. You can also add Dining offers exclusively in the App. [Learn more about Dining](https://www.rakuten.com/dining)
*   Make sure push notifications are turned on in the App so you know about in-store Cash Back deals near you.

**Getting your In-Store Cash Back**

Cash Back will be added to your account after the store confirms your purchase. The time it takes for Cash Back to be confirmed depends on several factors, including the store, store policy, reporting schedule, exclusions and returns.

**Card safety and security**

We take your privacy and security very seriously. Your credit card data is safely stored in a secure, encrypted environment that has been certified as compliant by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI). You can learn more about PCI compliance at [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). For more information on how Rakuten handles your private information, please see our main [Privacy Policy](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/privacy-policy-115009657667) and the [In-Store Cash Back Terms & Conditions](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/in-store-cash-back-terms-conditions-115013738007)."
https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/your-instore-cash-back-cards-360002100528,"In-Store Cash Back works by letting you link Cash Back offers to a credit card. Any card information you share with Rakuten is held in a secure, encrypted environment and will never be exposed, sold or otherwise compromised.

[Read our In-Store Cash Back Terms & Conditions](https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/terms-conditions-360002101608) 

**Qualifying In-Store Cash Back cards**

You can link most American Express cards, most Mastercard credit and debit cards, and most Visa credit and debit cards to your Rakuten account. In-Store Cash Back offers cannot currently be linked to other cards, including store cards that do not carry American Express, Mastercard or Visa logos. If you shop with more than one card, feel free to link multiple cards to your account.

**Special instructions for debit cards**

To earn In-Store Cash Back with your debit card, be sure to run it as credit and sign for your purchase, instead of using your PIN. Rakuten will not be notified of PIN transactions, so you will not earn Cash Back for those.

**Adding a card to the In-Store Cash Back program**

1.  [Sign in](https://www.rakuten.com/my-account.htm) to your Rakuten account
2.  Under “My Account,” click on “My Wallet”
3.  Click on “Add a New Card” and enter the credit and debit cards you’d like to shop with

After your card is successfully added to your Rakuten account, simply visit the In-Store Cash Back section of Rakuten to link to offers from your favorite stores. Then you’re ready to go shopping.

**Removing a Card from the program**

If for any reason you would like to stop participating in the In-Store Cash Back program, simply remove your card(s) from your Rakuten account, following these steps:

1.  [Sign in](https://www.rakuten.com/my-account.htm) to your Rakuten account
2.  Under “My Account,” click on “My Wallet”
3.  Click “Remove” next to the card you’d like to remove

**PayPal**

Payments can be sent to the PayPal account of your choice. You’ll be asked for verification when you select this method or update your PayPal email address. For more information about PayPal verification, please visit [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/).

https://www.rakuten.com/help/article/how-to-shop-with-the-rakuten-cash-back-button-360002100788,"It’s easy! Once you have the Cash Back Button installed to your browser, just head to the site you want to shop. The Button will automatically notify you if Cash Back is available. Select Activate Cash Back and that’s it!

You can also activate Cash Back by selecting the Cash Back Button icon in your browser’s toolbar. Whatever way you choose, we’ll confirm that Cash Back has been activated so you know everything is working.

The color of the Button icon in your browser’s toolbar tells you if Cash Back is available or activated:

*   Purple - The site doesn’t offer Cash Back.

*   Red - Cash Back is available. Select the icon, then select Activate Cash Back.

*   Blue - You’ve activated Cash Back.

**More features**

In addition to finding and activating Cash Back, the Button will also search for the lowest price on a specific product and let you know if we find one. And if the store you’re shopping doesn’t offer Cash Back, we’ll let you know if there’s a similar store that does.

Select the icon in your browser’s toolbar to see coupons and deals for the site you’re visiting, or to get a snapshot of your account, including how much Cash Back you’ve earned.

**Cash Back Activated confirmations**

When you activate Cash Back through the Button, you’ll see a confirmation that a Rakuten Shopping Trip has started. If you don’t see a confirmation, Cash Back wasn’t activated. This might be because some stores don’t allow notifications on their site, or they don’t offer Cash Back through the Button.

If this happens, try these fixes:

*   If the Button icon in your browser’s toolbar is flashing red, select the icon, then select Activate Cash Back. When the icon turns blue, you’ve activated Cash Back and you’re ready to shop!

*   Go to rakuten.com and search for the site you’re shopping to start a Rakuten Shopping Trip.

**Activate at every visit**

Be sure to activate the Cash Back Button every time you visit a site. If you make two separate purchases on the same site, you’ll need to activate Cash Back through the Button both times to get Cash Back. Why? Rakuten works by getting a commission from stores for sending you their way, then sharing it with you as Cash Back. Activating Cash Back through the Button lets a store know you’re shopping through Rakuten.

*   Cash Back at eBay depends on the category and sometimes the rates can change. You can always check the latest Cash Back rates on the [eBay store page.](https://www.rakuten.com/ebay)
*   Cash Back is only eligible on completed Winning Bid or Buy It Now transactions. An item must be paid for to earn Cash Back.

Cash Back with Rakuten is always earned after a purchase is completed. When you first book a trip or rental, the travel company considers that to be a reservation, even if your credit card has been billed. Once you’ve finished your trip and the company confirms payment, your reservation becomes a completed order and the company will let us know. Timing can vary a little, but you’ll usually see your (often pretty significant) Cash Back in My Account within 3 months of your trip."

Returned or cancelled orders may void Cash Back and be deducted from your Cash Back Balance, depending on the store’s policy. If a store processes your exchanged order as a cancellation and a new transaction is created, the exchange may be treated as a cancelled order.

To ensure you receive Cash Back on exchanged orders, you can instead return the item and place an entirely new order at that store. Just make sure to start your shopping with Rakuten.

New to Rakuten? [Sign Up](https://www.rakuten.com/american-express.htm) for a free account to start earning. When prompted, enter your American Express account username and password. Once your American Express account is connected, you’ll start earning Membership Rewards points when you shop through Rakuten.

**How does the Membership Rewards points program work?**

Earning Membership Rewards points with Rakuten is simple:

1.  Start at Rakuten and choose a store. You can use our website, mobile app, or browser extension.

$1 Cash Back = 100 Membership Rewards points.

**When will I get my Membership Rewards points?**

To get your American Express Membership Rewards® points, make sure you earn at least 501 confirmed points before the payment date. Points must be confirmed by the store before the payment date to be included in your points transfer. If your Earnings Balance is 500 points or less, it will carry over to the next payment date.

**Getting Paid**

Any confirmed points you earn on purchases, bonuses and other rewards will be transferred to your American Express account every three months. The time it takes for points to be confirmed depends on several factors, including the store, store policy, reporting schedule, exclusions and returns.

Rakuten Payment Dates:

*   February 15
*   May 15
*   August 15
*   November 15

For more details, go to [Earnings Balance](https://www.rakuten.com/pending-cash-back.htm).

**How do I know if my American Express card is eligible to participate?**

This agreement to arbitrate includes any claims against Company’s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of Company. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding in state or federal court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.

4.2 All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration.

This means that neither you nor Company can seek to assert class or representative claims against each other either in court or in arbitration and no relief can be awarded on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator also may not consolidate or join another person’s claim with your claim or issue an order that would achieve the same result. You and the Company further agree that if the provisions of this paragraph, known as the “Class Action Waiver,” are found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entire provision compelling arbitration shall be null and void.

4.4 To the extent possible under your local law, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules or pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”). The Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. If your claim in arbitration is for less than $10,000, Company will reimburse you for filing and arbitrator fees at the conclusion of the proceeding unless your claim is found to be frivolous by the arbitrator. The exclusive venue for any dispute or issue arising out of this Agreement shall be held in San Francisco County, California.

DBA Rakuten Rewards, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, Attn: Legal. Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which you have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.

You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. dba Rakuten Rewards, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, Attn: Legal within thirty (30) calendar days of enrolling as a Member or using Company Properties.

You may opt in to participate in Cash Back for Change at any time. To donate a portion of your next Cash Back payment and subsequent Cash Back payments, opt in by the first day of the calendar month of your next Cash Back payment. Otherwise, Cash Back for Change may not collect your donation from your next Cash Back payment.

6\. Reporting for Charitable Tax Deduction. We are not required to provide (and you will not receive) any contemporaneous written acknowledgment of donations made through Cash Back for Change to support a charitable tax deduction on your personal income tax return.

**1\. Cash Back Shopping.** The browser extension is made available to enhance your shopping experience with www.rakuten.com by providing you with relevant offers and references displayed on your browser. When you visit certain sites, the browser extension may display Cash Back shopping opportunities and prompt you to start your Cash Back shopping session via www.rakuten.com. The browser extension may also alert you of a deal or offer available through www.rakuten.com with respect to a product or brand appearing in your search results or on other pages you visit across the web, and prompt you to start a shopping session at one of our merchants. If you start a shopping session using the browser extension, it will set a cookie (or other similar tracking technologies) on your device through our affiliate network for the purpose of tracking your shopping session and crediting your Cash Back reward — just as if you had begun your shopping experience via any of our links to merchant sites on www.rakuten.com. Please note, however, that if cookies or other similar tracking devices from other affiliate marketing companies related to that merchant are already present on your computer, the browser extension will not automatically overwrite those cookies or shopping session but may still offer you the ability to start a Cash Back shopping session when you arrive at a merchant’s website.

**2\. Data Collection and Usage.** When you are interacting with the browser extension, we will collect information about the coupons, deals, merchants, products, and offers you click on. The browser extension also has some functionality that does not depend upon your interaction with it. By installing our browser extension, you enable Rakuten to automatically collect information on the pages you visit on your browser so that we can surface relevant offers, such as when Cash Back or better deals are available with our merchants. In addition, the Rakuten Cash Back Button may alert you of a deal or offer available that you had previously selected but had not purchased on a merchant site. Our browser extension may also collect information on the results pages of any searches you make so it can surface offers and deals where they are relevant (for example, we may display a Cash Back offer within a search engine results page that is related to those search results or a dining offer on a restaurant review website). We may also collect information about your shopping behavior for internal testing purposes. Information collected by the browser extension for these purposes may include date and time of use, browser type, browser version, URLs of web pages visited, general information about the visited web page, product searches, product search results, information about products added to cart, and other product information. The browser extension may also collect and use data, such as the order contents and order total, from order confirmation pages so we may confirm your Cash Back faster and more reliably. We do not intentionally collect nor use other types of information that may be included on a merchant’s order confirmation page, such as your address or partial payment information, although this information may be incidentally captured to the limited extent it is displayed by the merchant. Any data collected by the browser extension will be used, stored, and/or disclosed in accordance with this Rakuten Cash Back Button Privacy Notice and our Privacy Policy (set forth at www.rakuten.com/privacy).

**3\. Your choices.** You may turn off certain browser extension activities by visiting the “Settings” option within the browser extension. You may also turn off all data collection by uninstalling or disabling the browser extension.

**4\. Updates.** We may update the browser extension when a new version is released or when new features are added. These updates occur automatically, but we will update this Rakuten Cash Back Button Privacy Notice in the event of a material change in the information being collected or a new use for collected information that is materially different from the uses described herein.
