This is useful in case a user or an admin needs to locate the projects connected to DATA Source before deleting it. They can simply locate the project owners and inform them about the planned removal of Data Source.\\xa0\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## **Steps:**\\n\\n**1\\\\.

Once logged in, click on Data on the left panel and it will automatically show you a list of Data Source on the right. (\\\\*\\\\*Note: By default, the page will bring you to Data Source, but you will also have an option to navigate to Data Sets)**\\xa0\\n\\n**![Screen](https://tickets.dominodatalab.com/hc/article_attachments/17265888753172)**\\n\\n**3\\\\.
